I enjoyed this comic so much, watching Thanos go about on his personal quest to putrid the universe of it's scum and outhink the wierldders of the Infinity Stones (yes, the gems also get their individual name and introduction in this comic so holds the significance) with his intellectual prowess. Sorry for my expression but I wasn't aware that the comic artists held science and is theories with great respect and scrutinized them and embedded the scientific terminology in the comics. It really is a great work and the artwork on this is just stunning, for a comic written in the early 90's this is indeed a masterpiece of art and writing combined with great characters that will surely I down in history as the greatest fictional personas ever. The reason this comic outdoes itself is because the art paired with a great storyline with a very popular villainous diety out to grab all the power the universe has to offer and I'm all for it. Jim Starling deserves a lot more popularity, credit and attention. The full page art paired with the edgy and hardcore dialogues by the Titan just seal the deal, I'll be continuing the exploits of the mad Titan in the infinity Gauntlet as soon as I'm done writing this.

Compared to other comics I've read till date, I did not expect Dark Horse comics to have such quality content not that I don't love Dark Horse. This is beyond ordinary, it is exceptional and brilliant in every possible way and trust me this review will mostly be a rant about how fascinated and charmed I was with this gem of a graphic novel which is a truly explicit and gory retelling of the classic 'Snow White's. Neil Gaiman nailed the story, I did not expect anything lesser than this, that man is brilliant and undoubtedly my favorite graphic novel writer and producer but I had no idea Colleen Doran had such exceptional skills and I was totally dragged in by her full page illustrations. At the end of the book, she reveals in her afterword a lot of facts relating to the production of this 70 paged marvel which also was written very well and offered some facts I was unaware about. This would be the perfect Halloween read and I'm glad I read it in a single sitting. The story itself took surprising turns and haunted me, I did not expect being chilled out by what seemed like a young adult Graphic Novel but it gripped me by the throat thanks to it's dark and grim theme and frequent promiscuity and Bone Chilling dialogues. Watch out for this, this may break out very soon. Absolutely bloody brilliant. Need more of these. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

The enormous number of characters, superhero teams, galactic epmire and cosmic dirties is stunning and incredible at first so comic Rookies, you'll have to read the lead up first which is as good as this. Right from the beginning this comic had me on the edge of the seat as Thanos prowess and intelligence is unfathomable in battles and coupled with his intellectual capacity which is frequently highlighted. The art compliment s and visualizes the story really well and I loved the details and the depth of the whole thing. This comic is a complete package.and has a philosophical and scientific appeal to it too. Not for too young readers as they might not grasp the seriousness and the stakes in this but others will appreciate and get.ecited by the whole shebang that is the Marvel Comic Universe. It's a pretty.messy affair. The battle sequence was one of the greatest I've ever gazed up with Thanos manipulating the fundamental laws of the universe and benidng the superheroes to his own will and exploiting thier weaknesses.

Not does this comic comprise of more than a hundred or so characters but also a vast conjoining storyline spreading over the entire cosmos in existence. Of course, it features cosmic all powerful entities like Thanos, Magus, Adam Warlock and his Infinity Watch, Galactus, Infinity, Eternity along with the Avengers, The West Coast Avengers, The X-Men, The New Warriors and other superheroes indulging in a massive power struggle to prevent the destruction a s domination do the universe by the overly ambitious Magus who has returned more powerful than ever. Don't even get me started on the art of the comic book. It's brilliant, colorful and the artists deserve a lot of credit to fit the entire storyline with so much characters pages after pages with the same brilliance and quality of inking. The covers of the graphic novel are or course my favorite part but the opening double paged intros really makes the reader think about the complications that the writers and artists must have had to face. The way they added art to each frame and the overall stylizing of the comic is very intriguing and appealing. The story progresses with an acceptable pace with great dialogues, quotes many of which I'll definitely commit to memory. I was a bit hesitant to begin this graphic novel as I've never read an all out avengers, multiverse crossover event of this this Titanic proportion but I'll be continuing this journey by picking up Infinity Gauntlet, Thanks Quest and Infinity Crusade immmidiately after this. Being a big fan of the MCU I can now finally boast having the knowledge about Adam Warlock and multiple other heroic exploits that haven't made it to the big screen yet. Right from the beginning the comic had my interest which just grew over the six issues and delivered a massive blow (in a good sort of way) by the climax. I mean, a lot of awe inspiring events take place in here. This is not your regular Marvel comic. The stakes.are.higher than ever and with so many characters battling and trying to control the situation I'm thrilled to see.thst this forumla actually worked and thankfully did not have any complaints regarding whatsoever about the comic. Marvel fans need to pick this up immmidiately<br/> The character building and the consistent cosmic art with the Infinity Gems and the Divine power flashing across the pages really hits a new high for me. I'm also thankful for introducing me to an unprecedented venture into crossover multiverse comics. Trust me, this is huge. Had a very nice time reading this.

It has so much more appeal than an E-Comic. Right from the first page, I knew that I was in for so much thrill, adventure and some. deep hidden philosophy when I read the first page of the Graveyard book's Graphical Novel Adaption. I mean, the writing and the artwork is just stunning, brilliant and indulgent. This was real easy for me to read and enjoy. Gaiman's classy narration accompanied by the colorful, playful and detailed artwork by different artists really sets the mood for reading and enjoying the story of Nobody Owens, right form the beginning the story grips the reader and drags him in the chilly, misty, Victorian era styleee Gothic graveyard where most of the story takes place.  I got this cozy and relaxed feeling from reading thiiis book which says something really good about the way it's written. Of course, being a graphic novel it's artwork and text bubbles style is unique in it's own way and not too bombastical bit not too indie, just perfect for a adventure, insightful story. You may be surprised that each chapter has been drawn by a different artists with their own peculiar and unique style but it works really well with the book and gets the message across the reader that no matter the drawing style of the artists, the character's and the setting for the book remains true to it's theme and philosophy. I really loved the first half of the book with the man Jack hunting for baby Nobody and his young years at the Graveyard. The second half was contemplative, Serene and had mixed messages for the reader but also very enjoyable and highly creatively drawn. The artwork on this deserves so much appreciation. initially, the reader might not get where the story actually wants to head but once you are done with the first two chapters you never want to put down the book. My favorite chapter from the graphic novel was 'Danse Macabre', you'll see why. This book will work so well with readers of all ages though I would suggest younger audiences to pick them up for not just a cozy comfortable read but a lot of learning experience and anticipation too.  This book impressed me by all means. Hopping on to the next. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

Through and through. The end was so satisfying and awe inspiring. The Graveyard book Vol. 2 builds upon the original characters very much and brings back some beloved characters back into the storyline for drama, action and emotional wisdom which is executed very well with talented artist coloring the pages of the graphic novel with hues of passion, hearty dialogues and a strong build up towards the climax. I have one major aversion with the storyline though due to which this book will lose one star resulting in a solid and we'll deserves four star rating and that is the 'Jack of All Trades Organization's which plans the assassination of children throughout history to eliminate their destined rival adolescent teen who might just decimate their 'all powerful reign throughout history'. I mean, what the hell? Certainly they could put up a better story but this seems like an excuse for the writers to just ignore the key component of the man Jack's part in assassination and how vital plot point that was. But enough complaining, other than this everything about this graphic novel was crisp and delightful to read. If course, the art mostly has natural elements with the beautiful potraits and landscapes of the Graveyard and the ambience of a European town with the birds, skies and hills which frequent the comic panels. The final chapters art was stunning, breathtaking and deserved careful inspection by the reader. I did get a cozy and comfortable feeling reading this graphic novel just like I did while reading volume 1 which implies that it did not lose its appeal and it's philosophy. There were a lot of lessons to learn from the story about life, growing up, revenge and the mysteries and the trials the modern man must face. Other than the man Jack gripe this was an almost perfect adaption with a lot of passion. The story keeps propelling forwards with an indulgent atmosphere and coupled with Scarlet, the dreamy girl we saw in Vol. 1 the formula works with absolute perfection and satsifies the readers. The ending scene with the lilac Dawn skies and the mist shaped white rider with Bod ready to face the world, finally all grown up was so satisfying that it is beyond the scope this review. Also, Scarlet added a lot of depth to the story and played an important part in bringing all the antagonists, protagonists and sidekicks together for one final epic climax under the chapel. The Graveyard itself symbolizes different aspects and phases of life, acts as a very powerful metaphor. Also we learn much more than we previously did about Silas and Bod's spectral parents as well as other members of the Graveyard ghost community and each of their stories guides and shapes Bod as he grows into adulthood. A pleasure to read. I very strongly recommend that young children pick this up for a memorable reading experience that will definitely resonate through your adult years. Really, graphic novels deserve the praise and affinity in the modern world and this is a very good example of philosophy intertwined with symbolism. Loved it! Nice Reading!",,,1,0

I've never been so invested in this series before. This was the perfect mix of action, thrill, suspense and revelation. The last issue left me awestruck hungry for more. Considering this to be the fourth volume, I had expected a lot more to happen, like I expected the story to progress on a massive scale with a time jump and stuff but this is more meaningful and subtle. The character development is very strong and I absolutely love the Locke family so much more than I did in the last issue. Tyler is reallyso much more mature, responsible and much more like his father in all the ways. Its not hard to guess that the writers planned all the intricate details ahead of this volumes release. The story takes many surprising turns and amazes the readers, especially the first and the last issue. The art is appreciable and works as the artists creative license with diversity as it explores multiple nature's and moods and the art style changes accordingly, this is seen and highlighted in the first issue. The story progressed really well, smooth in fact, throughout the volume and added much depth and complexity to an already magical world. The new keys and Zack nature act as plot progresses and add to the thrill and enjoyment of reading this comic. I really loved the mechanisms of the working of the new keys and how advantageous it is to the Locke family ultimately. The character interaction, even between the secondary characters is worth noting and enjoyable. The last issue really made a radical change in the storyline and <br/>I'm more than excited to see where the story heads from here. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

Absolutely hit the sweet spot. This was magnificent. It was glorious. It was epic in a sense and it nailed the ending and surprised me in a hundred different ways. The entire comic reading expiereince of the Locke & Key series was absolutely worth it. I'm really going to miss my favorite characters. I have to say that I finished the entire series in under a week and it felt so damn good. The art, the workmanship on the story and the heartfelt emotions of the characters as they grow up from scrawny dull witted teens to mature adults! This was a gem indeed. The final volume begins on an entirely different scale and the authors and the artists want the readers to know that they are on an adventure of a lifetime with monumental events happening back to back shaking the readers to the core. A lot of deaths and demises take place in this one. Major and universally lived characters die, some honorably while others horribly. This volume had me on the edge of the seat. You never know what to expect. Between the second and the fifth volumes tensions are very high and the pages are jammed with action and sudden encounters. The endgame is launched earlier than expected. A lot of stuff happens in the caves rather than the Lockwood estate. The way I had to bid goodbye to some characters really was a bit hard on my heart. Their fading away seemed too much to take at one point. The art and the diloauges are on point and compliment the storyline really well. The amalgamation of all the plot points and all the key powers have been leading up the unexpected but highly anticipated ending which happened gloriously over the last two issues. I'm very happy that the members of the Locke family survived and the epilogue scene of Tyler with his Dad will be iconic and memorable. Matter of fact, this volume has many memorable and epic moments. It's really been an experience. I can't get enough of Locke & Key. Hopefully, this series makes its return sometime soon? Is it too much to expect? Amazing villains, powerful and surreal magic system, emotionally touching and developing characters and a memorable setting. This was all I could have asked for. The final volume really blew me away. A big hats off to the writers and the artists of Locke and Key series. Strongly recommended. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

The characters continue to find new keys with great and unimaginable power but mostly among those, the time travelling key is the best find. Four of the six issues take place in the past exploring the origin story of Zack, the escaped demon as well as the parents and ancestors of the Locke children. It was amazing to see the past with all the friends of Tyler's dad and their relations working their way up through college and making unforgivable mistakes. I think this issue takes the graphic and the verbal abuse to a whole new level. I don't consider this to be the best volume from the series because of its inconsistencies and how it breaks the momentum from the past volume. But I'm very glad that they chose to offer an origin story diving in the past. Now, things have become much more clear and there is hardly any mystery left at all. Plot wise, nothing new happened, everything that was revealed concerned the ancestors of the Locke family,inor character developments and primarily focused on the sprouting of the Evil in Locke house. Zack's mentality and origin is widely explored here and that is brilliant. The art and the dialogues were great too. It would have been much more amazing if the present timeline progressed a bit as well. Anyways, this was an enlightening experience which was necessary and essential for any Locke and Key comic Series fan. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

I absolutely loved it. Much more than I did the last two. The story has transitioned really well from an external danger to an internal one. The conflict between the souls of Sam and the evil woman from the well was really something else. I liked how the Locke children including Bode have matured and are handling the situation with the best of their capacity and Ridell even managed to thwart off the Woman in the Well really well in the fifth issue which is as glorious as it gets with stunning artwork you just can tlook away from. The fourth and the fifth issue add the shadowy atmosphere and action packed sequence which is highly entertaining. The first three issues explore each of the characters as they realize their mistakes, work on themselves and emotionally progress. It's really been an amazing journey through the first three volumes of Locke & Key. I loved the Dynamics of the new keys and how powerful the Locke family is slowly turning and batting off all the possible evil. We even saw the deaths of multiple secondary characters but it really moves the reader and progresses the plot of the overarching story really well. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

Locke & Key has an amazing premise. I'm right now, just into the first volume and I feel like I've been a fan of this series for a much longer time. It took me no more than two days to fly through the 200 pages of amazing plot progression, interesting complex characters and a foreboding atmosphere that lingers throughout this volume. The premise itself is very believable and Practical. I like the way the comic makes transitions between the past and the present with visual imagery to distinguish the timelines. For a comic book released in 2008, it has peculiar art which I'm all in for. The characters' faces are gloomy and twisted most of the time. I could do more with more profound dialogues. There's just one dialogue that stuck with me through this book. The final two issues built up the momentum leading to the finale very well. I'll be devouring the next volumes right after this. Locke & Key would have been a million times more amazing if I had read it a couple of years earlier. Still, a very powerful and though-provoking comic with just the right amount of magic and weirdness to it. I hope it only gets better. Loved it! Nice Reading...",,,1,0

The comic transitions from one plot arc to another so we'll. I mean, the story has changed radically, we see new faces, new plot points and the comic goes back and explores the history of the Locke family and the manor along with some other key players in the story. Even though, I've just finished the first two volumes of Locke and Key I feel like I've been a huge fan of this franchise forever. The art still remains peculiar and uncommon which is a very good thing for a book which delves into the horrors and wierdness of the people that the central characters surround themselves with. I could never guess where the story was heading. There's a lot of emotional buildup too my favorite characters to. Everybody is dealing with the aftermath of shocking events from the previous volume and while some things get better for now, the overall situation had gotten worse and what the most interesting part of it is that the characters don't even realize the danger they are in currently. I really loved how the book took very unpractical ideas and boldly showcase them to the readers which yields very powerful and entertaining results. Many pages from the comic are going to be stuck in my head for a very long time. This is definitely not a comic aimed at kids, even mature readers should beware because the line of dilouage and violence gets out of hand very suddenly and unexpectedly and adds to the thrill of reading. The book could certainly do with more profound and intellectual dilaouges and a better colour pallets but apart from this nothing to complain about. Very gloomy and dark, just like the first one.

A beautifully illustrated comic book series separated into multiple storylines and following a multitude of powerful and violent male residents of Basin City featuring Uber hardcore gun-violence, sex, degenerate and corrupt villains and promiscuous women of the Old Town. Most of the characters are quite reputable mafias or underdogs which rise to a great height and the scope of the story is at most times limited by the Damsel in Distress and the Knight in Shining Armour as well as the Beauty and the Beast paired with Sin & Sex tropes which are almost present at every single turn of the page. For me, this was an easy breeze. I read it almost as fast as I read mangas and finished the entire thing in under 5 days. Most of it is B&W which suits the dark and gory theme very well but the author introduces hues like yellow and blue as well as a hint of red and orange mostly towards the sixth and the seventh volume for the sole purpose of highlighting some events and drawing attention to the central female lead. The art deserves five stars, there's no question or even a slight doubt about it. The shadows, the intricate details and hell, even the smallest of the references and the Easter eggs are packed in an awe-inspiring and jaw dropping package. The first four volumes were easily my favorite. The final three felt a bit repetitive but had an entire different and original cast of leads and had I read those volumes after at least a gap of three-four days, they would too be flawless in story. The Sin city world develops very quickly through each book, the lore of Basin City, the authority, the Old Town women, especially Nancy as well as the big bad Roark frequent all the volumes and chapters and have a backdrop or at least an overarching influence in terms of plot and character path. Mav is a classic character, McCarthy is the one I emphasized with the most. Dwight is another great character and deserves an appalud. Most of it is explicit, has storng but very incentive lagunage, the dialogues are the greatest and the most attention drawing feature after the artworks of Sin city. I found the short story collection worth reading too, it only adds to the story as well as It's super easy to blaze through after a Sin City Fatigue. I plan to watch both the movies tonight itself and I'm awestruck how much paralle they draw from the panels directly. The mood of the comic; the stylistic, progressive, inventive, ingenious and the gothic artwok; the poignant, immorally superior as well as the infamous and unrelenting villains and charismatic but somewhat degenerate protagonists had all my attention and for this sole reason the book deserves a solid five star rating. The storyline was perfect and I loved all the aspects of it. RECOMMENDED! Nice Reading.",,,1,0

I don't think I've ever been so cool scared and chilled out as I have while reading this masterpiece. It also brings up Batman's dark history and his immoral side. The Joker takes up the terrifying level to new heights with the rich gory art and dramatic interpersonal dialogues. The other antagonists were also quite creepy. The art in the book and the though process of the writer while scripting this really stands out. Certainly one of the most memorable and enlightening graphic novels I've read this year.",,,1,0

The entry if Dr. Manhattan in the story adds some unpredictable and wierd elements to the story. Nobody can guess what happens next. The action is high and the art is appreciable. I don't know why Batman, Superman and Ozymandias are teaming up to convince Dr. Manhattan. I don't even know whether the parallel Earths' superheroes realize what's at stake. The Mime and his wife having a baby seemed out of the blue but it's alright. They had an amazing character arc. Watching Rorscach beating the hell out of Joker? Never expected that but it was hella good. The cryptic dilaouges of Jon Osterman are always a bit creepy but nostlagic. Loved this issue. <br/><br/>#8<br/>The last page of this issue give me chills. Finally, we are getting to the main event. I was awedturck to see my once favorite Arrowverse characters, Ronnie Raymond and Professor Stein merged into firestorm. Actually, the main theme of this issue is different from others but helps in pushing the central plot forward. The art and the brilliance is evident throughout. This was perhaps the most thrilling issue. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The convergence of national to declare a world war and assume power over each other is getting out of hand and the way the last 10 pages of the issue addressed the miscommunication between Superman and the Russians was well done. Firestorm was the primary character here but was misinterpreted. Ozymandias saying 'It Begins' reassures that he has formulated/orchestrated something to his benefit in his plan to save the world for once and for all. I'd like to see more superheroes converge and assist the right and set things straight. This was a good one!<br/><br/>#9<br/>Things have got out of hand and the finale feeling that everything builds up to something grand is hitting me hard. The opening pages of this issue collectively brings together the Entire DC universe superheroes(Just like Marvel did with the Infinity Crusade) as they make way for Mars to try and find who tried to frame Superman and Firestorm. Lex Luthor makes an appearance. The battle scene at Mars were the very best with art and imagery still spilling all over the place. Dr. Manhattan's dialogues still hit hard with the same punchline and effect like that of Watchmen. The entropy in the storyline has increased massively. The Doomsday Clock is a truly epic and massive event, no DC fan should miss this. I don't know what Ozymandias has planned but the world is at stake here. I like how the battle is played on two fronts, a more violent on Mars and a diplomatic on Earth by the Wonder Woman! We are getting to the part I love the most.<br/><br/>#10<br/>This issue was entirely narrated by Dr. Manhattan and you know how good that is. Much like the Watchmen issue, Dr. Manhattan tells his take about switching/alterating the metaverse. The coming of Superman on Earth has been delayed by years and it affects the timeline, enraging Superman who wishes to eliminate Dr. Manhattan. I was not entirely sure of this theory but it's alright. The flow of words on the pages is interesting. Many memorable quotes and dialogues here. I loved how they filled the readers with the black and white scene at the beginning as a part of a filming scene. This was a bit emotional and sentimental and was balanced very well. It sets up the final two issues. Let's see where this goes. Dr. Manhattan is on!<br/><br/>#11<br/>The instant I read the last panel in this issue I had goosebumps on my skin and tears in my eyes, not from sorrow but from the brilliance of the writing and the visual imagery and the conglomeration of the two. Things have escalated. This issue was narrated entirely by Ozymandias, just like Watchmen #11. There are a lot of parallels here. Ozymandias retells his plan and scheme to save both the worlds and makes a discovery along the way. The writing and the dialogues just hit hard at the right time and it has a great effect on the reader. Clearly, the writers and the artists have planned this issue or rather this event right from the beginning. Superman's plays a key role in Doomsday Clock and at one point Ozymandias even states that the Universe as well know it exists because of Superman. The world politics is exploding. In this penultimate issue, secrets are revealed. Superman and Manhattan face off against each other for the finale. It is going to be thrilling and epic in very sense. I'd like to watch a god bleed on one hand but thid like both the universes to be saved in the other. The philosophy of this comic book is astounding. Jumping to it now!<br/><br/>#12<br/>I knew right from the moment I picked this comic up, that this was going to be worth it. The final words of the comic book hit hard. The 'Doomsday Clock' is absolutely a worthy sequel to the Watchmen and incorporates multiple elements of the DC rebirth events in here. This finale issue brings back the Watchmen and the Ideal Superhero (Superman) philosophy back to life and spreads hope and optimism unlike ever before. The primary role of the issue is to focus on Dr. Manhattan's misinterpretarion of the choices one has in this universe and correct his mistakes by adopting a choice he never even knew existed. A very deserving end to a highly entertaining saga. The art and the colouring has been top notch throughout. Every single characters gets an honourable end. The Doomsday Clock embraces a positive philosophy and adds an ultra unrealistic but believable idea that Superman, forged by Doctor Manhattan exists in multiple timelines, on multiple Earths, ventures apart in some to protect and odelaize the goals of the universe and for mankind to find a life. I loved how, Dr. Manhattan embraces his human self and decided to give up his powers to the universe and the son of Mime and Mademoiselle. The last page where the boy says 'Jon calls me Clark's brought tears to my eyes and my heart leapt. A lot to creativity, efforts and passion has gone into this comic book. It was a worthwhile binge reading experience. I'm glad I picked this up. DC comics are the best. Nice Reading! <br/><br/><br/>",,,1,0

Branded with the Watchmen franchise, I set up my expectations really high because Watchmen is my favorite comic book of all time and this has to deliver something special to the narative to validate it's existence. Having read the issue, I can conclude that this is a worthy continuation of the original comic book and now I'm able to see it as an independent part of the whole. The Doomsday clock brings back the theme, the style, the narration, the characters, the pacing which makes it totally belong in the top tier of comics and brings some fresh, new generational ideas to the storyline. We are just getting started right now and I can't comment much on the story but the art is just brilliant with shades and dialouges boxes spanning entire pages. The tradition of enclosing newspaper extracts and other in-world journalism is continued at the end of the issue. We are seeing some big faces like Ozymandias and Superman so soon, I can't help but conjure some intricate plan coming up. This is leading to something, it definitely is. <br/><br/>#2<br/>Now, things have kicked off and the I can get my head around the motivation of Ozymandias and his aspirations to seek help from Dr. Manhattan to help the world save itself. The panel are was superb anderged very well with the storyline. The dialouges and the comic panels were intertwining which added to the narrative effect. I can't help but wonder about how this comic book is going to affect the Watchmen TV show now right we are continuously absorbing events happening at three timelines. This is a brilliantly crafted story with the art and dialouges merging to for unique, rarely seen patterns on the pages. Surprises have started to sproutm can't believe they introduced Batman, Lex Luthor and ressurected an alternate universe Comedian to kick start this epic and thrilling twelve issue comic book. The character development also seems to have taken a central place amongst other elements. I'm entertained. <br/><br/>#3<br/>What a great way to start the comic by reimagining the scene which defined and introduced Watchmen. The comedian and Ozymandias dueling was so cool. Elsewhere, the story progresses with the National Outburst of the public. We get so background on who the new 'Rorschach' is. This issue was action filled! Watching the two troublemakers dueling in the bar added a new sense of closed-space action sequences. My heart lost skipped a beat when I realized that Dr. Jon Osterman could be in the Arkham Asylum but I was surprised as the expectations of the audience were subverted in a imaginative manner at the last minute. This was a very entertaining issue with some key events happening. The world of Watchmen keeps on building. There's a tease of the political issue here and there along with the angst against vigilantism, just like in the TV series. This comic is venturing and exploring further into the world it has previously established very well.<br/><br/>#4<br/>The fourth issue of Doomsday Clock does something very similar to what Watchmen did to tell Rorscach's origin story and the vents which lead to him being how he is. A somewhat similar storyline with an overarching doom looming over the planet takes place here too. Of course, national breach of peace, revolutions and campaigns are still nigh. Reggie's story is dark. His psychological evaluation at the Arkham Asylum leads to him remembering the traumatic death of his parents and his sting belief in Rorscach's philosophy and his attempt to assassinate Ozymandias. This ssue felt a bit duplicate, copying the central them from Watchmen. But sthere are still some jaw-droppinf dilaouges and quotes here and there. The visual imagery and hints are still there, their frequency is on the rise hinting something radical happening soon. So far, I'm enjoying the pacing and the story of this worthy sequel.  <br/><br/>#5<br/>If the varioant cover with the Joker holding a bottle of 'Nostalgia' isn't scary enough, this issue brings the political statement of the comic to a whole new level. Interesting development take place. The action side of the story has well receded. We get to see a flashback to the Comedian's role in the events leading the the present. Lex Luthor and other DC universe characters like Batman, The Joker, The Troublesome Twins and Superman have well established themselves along with the Watchmen characters and the public seems like it will explode any minute now. This issue is high on tension but mostly informative. The art is very good, the dilaouges are a bit encyclopedic but it's alright. The ending of this issue left me surprised. Batman cannot seriously be dead!<br/><br/>#6<br/>Having reached halfway through the Comic book, I can conclude that this is as much a DC book as it is Watchmen. The villains have established themselves very well in this issue with the back stories of the two troublemakers flashing in front of them as they face off against a bunch of nuts ts, supers, etc. The political instability is addressed. The government mutant programs, to which Superman is regularly associated with is now revealed and full scale. This issue was full of explosions, nasty language and imagery. Also, Batman is still sterile. The two troublemakers looking for their son are the centre of the story of this issue. I wonder what Dr. Manhattan is planning? It's really hard to anticipate what's going to happen next, more so to prepare for it...<br/>",,,1,0

Created by the legendary Alan Moore and critically acclaimed for it's rich, complex and meaniful tone and narration I scrutinized every panel in this issue and easily got acquainted with the philosophy of 'Watchmen'. Just in these 35 pages, a lot of storytelling happens and this is undoubtedly a character and event driven storyline. I'll confess that the cast of characters is large and it gets a bit tough to track who's who but on the whole the build-up towards the end is noticeable at every page. A lot of detail and depth goes into the comic and it calls for the readers attention. The art is good enough, the script and the flow of the text bubbles is where this comic shines. I'm very much @eager and excited to finish this series off and see where things head next.<br/><br/>Issue #2<br/>Things are becoming much more clear and I'm getting a good idea about character elements and hidden plot points. Primarily this issue offers a lot of backstory about the disbanding of the Minutemen and the assembly of the Watchmen, a new league of superheroes who more or less want a better America and by extension, a better world. I loved this issue just a bit more than I loved the first one and that's saying a lot. Dr. Manhattan does posses a bunch of supernatural powers that fascinate me. There's something conspiratorial going in the background that hasn't been yet unveiled. The issue established the public dislike for the Watchmen and how it lead to their dismissal in the present timeline. The story is getting much more complex and detailed. I really have an affinity for side quotes, tags and comics panels merging into each other. The writers and artists of Watchmen certainly know how to engross the reader and tell a masterpiece, steadily and boldly. <br/><br/><br/>Issue #3<br/>This was much more intense and dramatic than the previous two. This felt more of an analysis and a powerful storytelling experiment that absolutely hit the mark. Most of the story here revolves around Jon Osterman a.k.a Dr. Manhattan as the news reports exploit and exile him for his supposed cancer contagian. The flow of the comic panel leave the reader engrossed and allow them to take in information the way they are comfortable. I was awestruck with the subtle hints and the way dialogues from one panel were shifted into another not as a contrast but with much symbolism and similarity. There is indeed a tangible and though provoking idea about Dr. Manhattan and his cosmic powers which add depth to the story. This issue had low key elements and introduction of the possible nuclear war. The imagery and color scheme in this issue captivated me and blew my mind. The dialogues intertwining with each other added a much more philosophical touch to the story.<br/><br/><br/>Issue #4<br/>This issue completely changes the way I'll be reading Watchmen. Told entirely by the point of view of Dr. Manhattan and constantly shifting in the past and the present, questioning the ruling of the universe with some truly impressive philosophy and awe inspiring quotes that are engraved in the mind, this is definitely my favorite issue of 'Watchmen' so far. The way the story begins and flows naratting the experiences and the life of Jon Osterman as he builds his empire on Mars in a somber solitude the reader is involved and impressed by the pace and the complexity of the story and how it addresses modern day issues. This issue focuses on the principle of the functioning of the universe, the existence of a natural order and force and how time is the ultimate key to all the events occuring simultaneously all over the universe. The symbolism of the watchmaker was fantastic. I never have been more involved in any other comic as much as I've been in Watchmen thanks to it's unique and intriguing narration style and poetic verse which is beguiling and enchanting to say the least. This issue also sets the tone and atmosphere for greater (or worse) things  the reader will stumble upon in later issues.<br/><br/><br/>Issue #5<br/>Feels a lot more like Issue #1 as things get momentum and the danger is high as ever. Rorschach continues his investigation with great intensity and recklessness to be honest and takes the readers along with him as multiple conspiracies, enemy movements and occurinces take place. His journal entries are certainly worth noting. This issue of Watchmen highlights and addresses the degradation and the deteriorating state of the world and where the modern civilization is heading, unchecked and enforced by vices. The symmetry of the story with the parallels was really interesting a very good move by the writers. I did not expect the issue to end the way it did. Also, the story is heavily narrated from another comic book inside this comic which helps the readers to contextually identify where the author plans to take the story and impress upon the themes and issues of 'Watchmen'. I'm very anxious and excited to know about the Mastermind behind all the vigilante elimination conquest. The stakes have never been so high. The color palette is vibrant and ingenious complementing the storyline.<br/><br/><br/>Issue #6<br/>This issue dives deep into the origin and the idea of 'Raschach' and how the vice, wicked and oblivious world shaped him to be what he is today. The events are recalled as he is consulted by a psychiatrist in police custody. The reason I loved this so much and read it with solemn respect and horror is beacuse this has been written without holding back and the world's true face and nature is revealed in a powerful prosiac way with a lot of philosophy and extravagance paired with exquisite comic panels. The book builds up towards the climax and I as a reader have a lot more respect for Raschach and the cruelties he has had to face in the prime of his life. This comic accurately delivers a kick to the reader that is shocking as well as much needed for the story to propogate. The thoughts, ideas and the life experiences narrated by Raschach are serious and worth scrutinizing. This issue also offered some interesting background on the psychiatrist and used imagery and metaphors wildly resulting in enormous impact on the plot and how the reader comprehends it. <br/><br/><br/>Issue #7<br/>There is something powerfully inspiring about this issue and I don't just mean within the comic. This issue makes the reader actually care about the real world and act a certain way and lend a helping hand to those in need because of the urgency of the cataclysm and the apocalypse that is nigh. Following the build-up to the relationship between Laurie and Den a.k.a Nite Owl and their subsequent act to get their act together and see the bigger picture and take a bold action of rescuing the commoners from the fire was something I'd never expect to happen. This also reflects upon the post disbanding of the caped crusaders. There's a lot of sensual pleasures shared, high tech machinery and inspiring quotes to notice. This issue gives an appreciative bod to the previous issues and continues a radical journey into the future and highly prioritizes the message that the masses must function together if survival is to be attained. Pleasureable reading as always.<br/><br/><br/>Issue #8<br/>A lot of stuff gets done in this issue. I mean, the story has propgated itself at a faster rate than I'd imagined but still offers much material for the reader to contemplate about. Dan and Laurie have stolen the spotlight and this couple is really interesting with complex character. The journalists and the detectives have taken the foreground in the bigger picture. The comic book inside the Watchmen which narrates the survivor highlights the dark, gruesome, ruthless and unrelenting face of the world. The danger of the apocalypse still stands high but seems a bit faded in this issue. As the supes team up again, the readers get to ponder and speculate upon the situation in '77 which led to their fallout. (which is a running gag/tragedy) Also, I'm very much hyped up about Dr. Manhattan saving the world and it really is going to be interesting to see where the story goes from here. Raschach seems to have hit rock bottom as he appears to conceal his emotions and thoughts. Lot of action, explosions and blood in this issue. Fun as always. <br/><br/><br/>Issue #9<br/>Watchmen is simply perfect. It's fantastic. It's brilliant. It's unparalleled and it's unprecedentedly important. Even as a comic it has so much to absorb from. Reading the last few pages of the issue truly raises some emotion from you as a reader. I literally had goosebumps. Dr. Manhattan's quote about life and it's unique fate was perhaps the best in the series. Watchmen is full on, unstoppable and tends to reveal a cosmic truth about life and its connection with the universe. The events happening in this issue are certainly anything but low key. The way the writers executed this complex narrative style impressed me so much. I mean it's a hell of a job to imagine and execute it with utmost perfection and that's why Watchmen is undisputably my favorite comic book ever. Secrets are revealed which in turn has consequences, grave consequences and changes the probable date of the universe. Also, most of the story takes place on Mars. The art is breathtaking. The philosophy behind the conversation between Dr. Manhattan and Laurie is unlike anything I've seen before. Absolutely the best.<br/><br/><br/>Issue #10<br/>This wasn't a typical Watchmen issue, jammed with revolutionary philosophy and over the top quotes. This issue features to-the-point business that needed to be done. The nite owl and Raschach Continue their mission to find the persona responsible for supes death and exile and arrive at a snow clad mountain follows the hints of the inner circle. The reveal at the end was certainly pondering upon. There's nothing extraordinary about this issue other than it's direct contact with the main story, depth, details in illustration and the distribution of the panels. Also, much of the story takes form the point of view of the masses and common celebrities as they anticipate the end of the world.<br/><br/><br/>Issues #11<br/>The way this issue began with such complexity of words and Extraordinary quotes regarding the study of human minds and the natural species of the world you know it's beyond what was though possiblem this issue overcomes and breaks through the limits of a comic book to deliver something more biblical and enlightening. Adrian is obsessed with Alexander and his journey is narrated in this issue which I loved all the way through. The monster madness conspiracy was a bit hard to believe but absolutely surprising and intricate. The whole endgame is revealed which answers most of the questions which were raised right form the first issue very satisfactorily. The color pallets of the book is stunning with forms of white, gold and green across the pages which adds a climax like atmosphere. Watchmen truly does symobolize the dread of the world and how ignorant people are of the looming doom over them. Adrian's motives and his master endgame was acceptable to me. But still, there was a gruesome and a freaky execution to it. Let's see. Can't believe I've arrived at the end of the journey. A lot will go down in the final part of this stunning and remarkable series.<br/><br/><br/>Issue #12<br/>Even as I knew Watchmen was unique, original and it carved its own way of storytelling I hoped that the world would be saved but I was way wrong. Of course, Watchmen will not go down the expected or the orthodox path. No, it will take the least expected path, something truly horrifying and teach the readers a hell of a lesson out of it. The final issue in the Watchmen series gives the readers apocalypse, crushing any and all of their expectations and promotion nhilistic approach towards the world. Raschach, the character who we all followed for numerous issues just died in a blink just beacuse he went to do the morally right thing and there's no remembrance of him anywhere. That points out how unrelenting and nhilistically superior Watchmen is. The end of the world and it's subsequent fruitful unison seems dark and gritty but like Adrian says, 'A downfall is necessary for tomorrow's building empires'. Can't believe that guy is still alive and kicking backed up by Dr. Manhattan. Still, the story went a bit sideways than I'd expected but it was original and satisfying till the end. This series did a great work of caring the least about the readers and this world's moral values and doing the rational and necessary evils that needed to get done and it deserves it's rightful praise and appreciation. The epilogue was heart wrenching but it's all cool now that the world has achieve piece though Dr. Manhattan questions it by stating that 'nothing lasts forever'. Watchmen will always have an enormous impact on today's pop culture and comic enthusiasts with it's rich and complex nature and philosophy that goes beyond the moral compass. Nice Reading. Absolutely my favorite comic!",,,1,0

This acts as a finale to the tnire seirs collecting the threadbares of the last stories and wrapping them in a yarn much like the opening visual. This is quite basically a tale of revenge and relinquishment. The death or the passing of Dream is a long time coming with the multiple hints which are prophecised in the story. The buildup is very slow and the side stories feel a lot duller much thanks to the cartoony art. But the same simplistic, one storke cartoony art is much more epic and eye capturing and attention grabbing during the final five issues in which the stakes grow higher. We see a lot of past characters returning only some allied with the Sandman but almost everybody of the secondary characters form a communion to end Sandman lead by the Lady Hall and even God's like Odin and Loki. The story was more stationary than I'd like it to be. Some of the dialogues were really great and the art bumped up during the ending. The first four issues are very slow but important as well as the form the basis of the reasoning and remind the readers about the universe outside the Endless as well. This was a well balanced and easily one of the most Sandman volumes. The secodney characters are various, the art is fantastic, the finale's payoff is interesting but it could do justice to the series with a much momentous and faster pickup during the initial issues of the volume.

Igad my expectations set insanely high because of the last volume and to be honest this was a let down, at least story wise. Not only is the notice not clear but this retelling seems too fairy tail-ish. Sandman does not stand for that. Yes, there is a bit of moral preaching and philosophical rant at the nd which ties all the strings but the idea for another Dreamworld with a bunch of girls stranded did not get me completely. The artwork has shifted and is really vibrant and colorful but also dialed down a bit, I don't know why but isn't sandman supposed to be more grittier and darker. Anyways, the frequent dialogues and quotes did entertain me but the story was a let down. A colorful and artistically impressive volume spanning a bit longer with a few memorable quotes spread over the pages and an underwhelming cast of characters. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

Morpheus matures. And move one step closer towards death, though he doesn’t yet know it.<br/>Sandman as a whole, is that so much of the story is based around acceptance. Acceptance of life, of death, of reality, of unreality. Acceptance of responsibility or utter rejection of it.<br/>Destruction comments on the role played by the Endless: “The Endless are merely patterns,” the prodigal brother says. “The Endless are ideas. The Endless are wave functions. The Endless are repeating motifs.” He wanted to break free from that narrowly defined, prescriptive role. And he knew that things would continue to be destroyed and new things built even if he, as the steward of the very concept of Destruction, was no longer responsible. The ideas were already set in motion. The machinery of the universe would see to it. <br/>for returning readers, or at least for me, Brief Lives seems, ironically, less than brief. It’s a bit wearying.<br/>Gaiman and Thompson still provide plenty of entertaining moments, and the requisite bits of pathos and tragedy and introspection (because, hey, it’s a Sandman story arc)Almost every page I flipped to showed the hyper-kinetic Delirium rambling on about something while Dream solemnly ignored her, or spoke to her in matter-of-fact tones. There’s a lot of that in Brief Lives. It’s so abundant that it almost becomes a parody of itself. Though it was an entertaining read, some readers will question the motive of this long stretched quest to find their brothers which will be answered and satiated in the final three issues which are remarkable in their own right talking about pathos, the loss of loved ones and the mess that life is. An enlightening volume. Never been done before. The first half is a bit boring though. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

Of course, the narrative it tells doesn't allow it to be dark and gritty like the majority/remainder of Sandman but it does more than justice to the story it tells. Each of the three issues tells about the Dream's/Morepheu's role in influencing the balance of power and the conquest of nation's in the history of the empire focusing on Roman Empire, Caesars conquest and the French revolution, slightly modifying historical figures for the propogation if the story. The characters are numerous, the dialogues are consistent and crowded but I love history so no complaints there. This sort of narrative wouldn't suit Sandman in it's linear plot but I'm considering this to be a set of short stories so it could t have been done better. Each story adds depth and importance to our 'Among the Endless' Sandman. The art earns most of my respect. A nice read on the side with amazing references and historically accurate writing.  3.5/5 stars. <br/><br/>Part II- Convergence<br/>This is also a set of short stories which narrates stories which are not linear like the last subvolume. A lot of my expectations were divulged but I'm really glad about the direction this volume took. My least favorite story is 'The Hunt' and the most favorite is a 'A Parliament of Rooks' and the Marco Polo story is also very interesting. The art is detailed thoroughly and complements the story. In almost all the stories the narration switches between third and second perspective which suits the tone. The character sketches and the overall drawing and coloring in this comic is superior compared to the earlier Sandman stuff but the some parts of the story lacks here and there and can fail to be interesting which might result in lessear attention. Certaibly, a bit better than Distant Mirrors where the reader doesn't know what to expect next. A decent addition to the franchise. 4/5 stars<br/><br/>Part 3- Issue 50(Ramadan) + Sandman <br/>Special (Song of Orpheus)<br/><br/>*Ramadan is my favorite entry in the Sandman series. It seems special with a template that's jaw dropping, a distinctive font and narration style that keeps things simple and focuses on the art of storytelling which is totally ideal and masterfully crafted. I was transported to the Arabic city of Baghdad and after turning the final page, I was sucked back into reality. It was that strong impression on me. The color palette used is off the charts. The story is stornglt built and of course has a Sandman touch to it. The artwork is detailed yet simple, The strokes precise and calculated. The ending/climax have me goosebumps. This issue if Sandman has not only perfected but also idolized the art of storytelling and narration. Wow, no complaints at all. I'm impressed. <br/><br/>*Wow! The Sandman Special: Song of Orpheus is on a whole new level. No, it does not have the groundbreaking art or even the rich linear narration but it does have a lot of human elements to it. Love and Death are the central messages of this volume. We see all the Endless' gathered yet again. Their boundaries and roles become more clear and defined. Each of them has a specific task to accomplish and they cannot favour family over it. It was suprsing to see Orpheus, Dreams son going on to the underworld to attempt to ressurect his wife but as expected the attempt fails. The metaphors are extensive and hint at the genius of the writers. The art could be a bit better seeing that this was a special. A lot of myth and emotions attached to this. 4.5/5<br/><br/><br/>Overall Rating-4/5",,,1,0

It's best when you dive in to such a magnificent and universally acclaimed series without much though to get the most out of it. Even though this is the first volume, I can see myself being a lifetime Sandman fan after this. Of course, the hype adds to the attention that I've paid while reading but Neil Gaiman's cryptic and metaphorical writing is all over the place. The art is raw and the artists creativity spills all over the page, it's bold and unrelenting. Sandman is a masterpiece, I hope I can say being just a neo reader. The story progresses building itself and the elements of the Dreamworld issue by issue. Honestly, there's isn't anything not to like. There's a lot of stuff here, almost genre bending. There's enough science and philosophy to keep any student pacing through the chapters and for the older readers there's some stuff about the workings of religion and the Divine plans of God. I have read some great comics and this certainly is an S class graphic novel to say the least. Sandman, in itself is a contained story. It does not shy away from existing in the multiverse with the protagonists living in the same world as Batman, Superman and the Joker and we also get a John Constantine cameo that was harrowing.

Truly, I had nothing to complain about this volume too. It's almost too perfect and awakening. Doll's House tells a new story, with Rose as the central character and the Sandman tackling down the four escapees of the Dreamworld. The story is spread out evenly and everything ties well enough at the end of the volume. Also we get a sneak peak at the third Endless, 'Desire' who plots against Dream. Three of the issues seemed to branch off and tell their own story and that really worked very well and took me on a sort of side quest with great visual experience and storytelling brilliance-the first issue, the issue with the Coranthian arriving at the Convention and the issue where Dream offers immortality to his friend, though not without consequence. This issue delves deep into the consequences of dreams and their effect on human lives as whole, how it shaped and forms us and our persona. It is very much realistic that at a point I almost believed it which I hope isn't very bad. The Dreamworld is expanded very well and with much depth. I hope the quality and the story keeps up with the same standard.

Nice Reading. <br/><br/><br/>Sandman Vol 4: Season Of Mists by Neil Gaiman Review <br/>This is undoubtedly and inarguably, the best lime from the Sandman series. Not only because of.its.epic proportions but also because it features a wide ensemble cast of secondary characters which I found hugely satisfying and highly entertaining. This volume had me on the edge of my seat. Right from the beginning with the Six Endeless having a ""family"" discussing regarding the Path of Destiny and discussing some cosmical plan or philosophical paradigm. Dream's realization about his mistreatments of Nada and Death nudging his conscience were the perfect events to kick off this volume. Can I just say how brilliant the art work is! It's not raw like that of Preludes and Noctures but way more sophisticated, intricate and highly detailed adding more volume and density to the intricacies of Dreamland, Hell and we even got a glimpse of the silver City which I hope will be revisited. I could go on an rant about each of the secondary characters which I think I will. The Norse God's and deities were overdone, especially Thor but that seemed essential and each of them (Loki, Odin and Thor) had a nice introdcting. The Chinese Emeperor, the Egyptian God Ra and Alazaz were some great additions too. I would never have anticipated or expected the story to take such a sharp turn at issue 22 when Hell was emptied and Lucifer actually and legitimately stepped down as the ruler of Hell. Thinking about it, that not only talks about the sense of the writer to not stick to an unoriginal and hype grab narrative but to experiment with the story, heightening and raising the bar yet again. Really, Sandmans experimental storylines, artistic highlights and creativity and the narrative really sets it apart from most of the comics I've read. The only complaint I have regarding this volume was the chapter 'The Return/Rise of the Ghosts/Spirits' which not only broke the momentum and the building of the story but also talked about a common schoolkid with some supernatural elements and life skills added to it. It's wasn't as cosmic or the other chapters but this volume easily deserves a 5 star rave review. Lucifer Morningstar also delivered some amazing commentary, monologue and earned some really great character moments in the earlier chapters of the volume. I, as a reader now know, perhaps, more about Hell (or at least the idea of it) itself that The Dreaming because of the exhaustive geographical tour and the elaborate description of the events and the functions of the fallen explained during the events of the comic. Of course, The Sandman himself undergoes a major character and tonal shift with his conscience coming into play and we see many of his other sides that have been mildly hinted before. That is one hell of an evolution. Also, Destiny was featured on the final page of the volume and that just adds a lot more depth to the narrative. So, all in all, this volume offers a lot of linear progressive narrative, immense character development and fantabulous art styles and coloring for a comic that dates back in the '90s. I'm very impressed. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

Jesse makes one hell of a protagonist. Each chapter has a culture to it, you can't escape the downright genius wordplay and the dialogues which are ingeniously crafted. The art is superb and modern but definitely not overdone. The overarching plot amazed me to a greater degree but the chapterwise plot is highly entertaining as well. Even the supporting characters have some sort of immoral characteristic attached to them which fascinated me. The story seems very real as it is based in Texas and Mid American States. The mounting action which paid off in the final chapter seriously was a delight to read. The first 5 chapters add a lot of spice while introducing rh characters and right from chapter 7, the plot shifts in the past and present adding a lot of depth to the characters by offering a perspective from a different point. Tulip is a worthy companion to Jesse, a true beauty with brains. Her introducing in the story goes very well and I cannot imagine her out of the narrative. Even Cassidy is one hell of a vampire. The story does not shy away from introducing supernatural creatures and hell, even divine intervention, like in the penultimate chapter where we literally watched Tulip being resurrected. The quest of finding God, who has vacated his throne in heaven is beyond my wildest dreams.  So far, I'm truly impressed by the story and the plot progression, not to mention worthwhile characters that we follow on the way. The graphic novel is quite quotable. A fantastic experience.

I acknowledge that I picked up this comic thanks to the Netflix series and was mind-blown. Both are absolutely entertaining and well detailed. I could notice a multitude of easter eggs, connections, mentions and character traits  reflecting from the series adapted from the comics. The plot and theme were also quite similar. The comic was a colourful masterpiece, the first volume spanning over 140 pages. This may seem a bit intimidating/ roller coaster ride for the uninitiated but dive in by all means, you are in for a great ride. The series has immense potential and I'd like to see more of 'The Umbrella Academy'. Each of the characters backstory is relatable and a bit heartfelt. Mr.Monocle a.k.a Prof. Hargraves will do much more good if he somehow makes back into the storyline. I absolutely love the emotionally scarred adult U. Academics and Vanya's role as a villain is groundbreaking. The motion and the way of drawing in the comic needs to be appreciated. A very well-planned, detailed and complicated superhero, fantasy comic I'm glad I read. The colours really sprawled on the screen and the digital artwork was unparalleled. Awesome. Deserves much more praise and attention. Loved it. Nice Reading.",,,2,0

The plot thickens and when I say the plot thickens it soars so high with intricate detail about the entire ghost hunting rituals, new characters and a large complex mystery involving timelines, locations and a multitude of characters so tread with caution and pay attention to detail if you really want to enjoy the book to its full. I found the writing style very similar and intriguing but a part of Lockwood's persona seems to have drifted away, a very tiny but noticeable aspect. Lucy gains much more attention in the book and in Lockwood's view she has daily surpassed George's abilities and probably become the most important member in the group and he values her a lot. I was able to notice a few intimate interactions between the two but I'm in two minds whether the author will ship em together. The central part of the book is about this whispering skull which near the conclusion helps our team to discover his true master who committed a crime and murdered people in order to get his hands on the 'mirror' which helps identify the phenomenon after death. The supernatural world is expanded at a rapid rate with third grade ghost discovery, interactions with Marissa Fitted and Lockwood's antgonism against the Kipps and other DEPRAC members. In terms of spookiness this book was nowhere near the first book by it has way more adventure and action. The climax was super busy for all the characters and George suffered a lot! I like how Stroud planned the entire scenario and let the pieces fall into their places with each chapter. I loved the revelation at the end. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

It's just freaked me out. I can read Jorg Ancrath killing, raping and massacring an entire town without batting an eyelash but the shot that I've suffered through this book is messed up. I get it, it's part of the plot and it is essential to the punch line and the climax but I'm sure there was a much better way to put the dreadful events in the book. At least, giving the readers a trigger warning. The 'adult' parts of the books we're ever consistent, repetitive and so frequent I was scared at a point that this was a complete fifty shades of grey ripoff but thank God it wasn't. The people who will vividly remember hating this book will be the only ones who leave midway and miss the ending. All the terrible writing, the bad choice of words and the horrendous sinful narration is all part of the act, but as a reader who processes this shit firsthand, it's a bit intense. Verity's Autobiography 'So Be It' was the most creepy and I can totally understand the author's choice to go all out with the details in the bedroom and the mothers hate towards the children and obsession with her husband was part of the plot all along but out of the journal the writing seems like Collin Hovers debut novel. I'm suspicious the author uses a writing tool or at least a very heft editor and makes use of fancy and teenagers choices favorite phrases and word schemes that are so out of date and have no appeal to me at least, not in fiction! But, honestly, the story was hooking, until it wasn't (All the So Be It Journal entries)<br/>  I'm glad I experimented with reading something of this format and unusual in all sense. I was addicted to reading this series because I knew that the ending was gonna blow me away but the journey towards the awesome ending was stretching and tiresome and felt unnecessary and repelled me. But in the end, it was absolutely worth it. The 3-star rating isn't because the plot is bad but because of the intentional bad writing in the journal section and a few narrative choices that I just couldn't help overlooking. Enjoyable complex characters, amazing hooking introduction, brilliant climax. The journal entries are the worst though. Cringe!!! Nice reading.",,,1,0

It is a very surprising fact that Charles Osborne could replicate eht writing style and neraly convey the same message that the author tried conveying the readers. This was a completely different story, you can actually feel it beginning and ending in a very odd yet satisfying manner. I really love the way the story progresses and events line up against each other providing a scientific, rational and chronological explanation. There are some simple yet obscuring conspiracies unmasked here which is fun and exciting, The story is quite simple with a limited cast of characters as it's a short book makes it much easier and quicker to read. I adored the characters and how the atmosphere is laid out. The author hit sure Mark where it was supposed to be hit. Some moments are unnecessary but compliment other events in the future adding a greater depth over a small period of time. There's not much action, adventure and Chase scenes however there is notable family politics, gunshots, firearms, suspense and extreme suspecting. Each of the characters in the chateau is unique and odd in their own aspects. Some universal philosophy is also portrayed. A dark mysterious homicidal air hangs in the pages throughout the book. The ending was just satisfying the characters were cunning and to tell the truth there remains in the end so assurity about who killed the victim. There are just clues and hints but the readers is left to conjure the probabilities and ponder upon it. The end was just beyond imagination and most surprising. Recommended for all. Short, quick, jiffy and entertaining read. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

(Including around 65 illustrations)<br/><br/>*REVIEW*<br/><br/>{Introduction} -  I picked up Tinder looking at it's rich cover, font and illustrations. It's a readers fascination. A very transformative, thrilling tale which will captivate dark fantasy and horror fans. It's inspired from Hand Christian Anderson's 'Tinderbox' ( A medieval fairy tale)<br/><br/>{Storyline} - Otto Hundebiss is tired of war, but when he defies Death he walks a dangerous path. A half beast half man gives him shoes and dice which will lead him deep into a web of dark magic and mystery. He meets the beautiful Safire - pure of heart and spirit, the scheming Mistress Jabber and the terrifying Lady of the Nail. He learns the powers of the tinderbox and the wolves whose master he becomes. But will all the riches in the world bring him the thing he most desires?<br/>Fairy tales are often the cruellest stories of all; in this exquisite novel Sally Gardner writes about great love and great loss.<br/><br/>{Characters} - The primary characters include Otto, Safire, 3 Human Wolverines (Very Terrifying and Ghastly) who rip humans and spill their guts, The Lady of the Nail, Duchess, Prince, Duke, villagers, beast man, soldiers and dream sequence characters. I just love the characters very much. Otto is the central figure who's haunted by his memories in war and how his family was slaughtered. He suffers a lot throughout the book and has bloody nightmares but still doesn't give up on his quest to find his eternal love. Safire is the next most important character, a beautiful nubile lass, graceful and beautiful. The Lady of the Nail, Duchess and the Prince are the primary antagonists(all unnamed) and have an air of malevolence amongst them. The characters are portrayed with great detail and they seem very clear with Rich illustrations. <br/><br/>{Scenes} - The scenes are mostly bloody, gory and explicit. The story moves with a swift and readable pace. Many events happen one after another, understanding the plot is very simple but to analyze and study them would be a lot more difficult. I love the highlighted dream sequence which are full of sadness and emotions related to death. The story is narrated with the principle of blood, war, death and violence but it's very entertaining. The wolves scenes was delightful and scary. Some mysteries are left unanswered. Scenes are mostly thrilling. The book is not at all for kids under 13. There's a lot of action and scares in the book that will amaze you.<br/><br/>{Locations} - Awesome! I have no other word. The locations in the book are few but all of them just hit the high spot. The locations are rich, scary, haunting and relate with the plot very well. They are complimentary additions to the plot which seems like icing on the cake. Primary locations include the forest where the characters are introduced. Then the next exciting place is the haunted palace where the tinderbox is hidden, ruled by the Lady of the Nail and the Duchess. You shouldn't ignore the beauty of illustrations in this arc, section. Next up we come to an unnamed Village, scary and dark where crime rules. Most of the characters are introduced here and most of the story is seen in this particular region. The plot grows a little complicated here. But nonetheless very mystical. O would like to treat Otto's dream sequence as a location because it just mesmerized me because of it's descriptions and philosophical thoughts filled with hate and pain. <br/><br/>{Speciality} - I would say that the primary speciality of the book is it's cover, illustrations, brigt White pages, good looking font and enchanting appearance. The book deserves to be read in paperback (hardcover, if you insist), it doesn't look a bit of what it's worth on Kindle. Secondary speciality is that the author explores a different genre, an offbeat storyline that's usually seen in movies and not in books. The book is very good, sorrowful and melodramatic with a lot of scares and haunt which accompanied by illustrations will surely terrifying you. The illustrator deserves as much credit as the author. Both have put in eual amount of work to present this rich and enchanting piece of art and story. The dream sequence is highlighted in dark black with white font and the pages have the smallest details and doodles. The story and characters are wonderful. This volume should be kept in a collection. Suggested for older readers.  Human emotions, death, birth and wars will make you ponder and reflect about humanity and the exploited class in the world. A very entertaining tale told in a lucid but effective way. The paranormal addition of the wolves I both paranormal and magical. The tinderbox is has the central importance on which the story is based. I loved the conclusion. This book redefines what you'd call *Love*<br/><br/>{Notes}- Should be read by children above 13.(explicit language used, blood and Gore, haunting and terrifying, death is highlighted in almost all chapters)<br/>Should read the book in silence, slowly and mesmerisingly. Do read the authors note and acknowledgement. <br/><br/>{Remarks} - Just loved the illustrations. Read the book in silence and enjoyed the melodramatic as well as haunting narration. A heavenly gift for lovers of horror and tragic fantasy. Some explicit content included. <br/><br/>{Rating} 5/5",,,1,0

I've been dreaming to read Sherlock Holmes since I was ten but then I didn't think I could comprehend it but now, it seems a live of cake and its my cup of tea.  I bought the free kindle copy (Unabridged and illustrated) from Amazon Digital. So just let's go to the review.<br/>   The book tells the official reminisces of Dr. Watson which is obviously fictional and how he met Sherlock and his together, he discovered Sherlocks great mind and his genius and together solved a great and a mysterious murder case. The book is written with Dr.Watson's PoV after his retirement from the army due to injuries and health. The story takes place in the later Victorian Era (or so I think) in the traditional heart of England where we see men in black coats, horse carriages, beautiful houses and the street crowded with people. The depiction of this period is remarkable and seems very true. The next interesting thing is the characters and the dialogues. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has created the characters so well, with a unique personality, likes and dislikes, speaking habits, egos and a lot more things. Their appearance and description is very well done which makes them appear real. The illustrations just personify them. The dialogues are witty, specific, particular, sometimes to the point and sometimes just humorous.  Obviously, the most addicting thing about the book is the famous theory of 'Science of Deduction' a skill that only Sherlock Holmes is capable of. I mean just observing things and deducing something which is rather personal or unbelievable is indeed interesting. Sherlock just takes a glance and you and knows a lot more than you than any ordinary person. This is and will stand the most interesting thing in the detective world. We see humour in here too. The way the story moves is nic. It follows a steady pace and a good plot which gets a but intricate and more detailed, the reader should bit read this book absent minded, if he does I guarantee that he will lose it. The murder, the meeting of Watson and Sherlock, the investigation at the crime case and the conclusion is what I like. The plot is truly unique and the story is enchanting and makes you hooked to the book. Part II is completely different  from what you'd expect. It may seem strange and boring in the beginning but it is linked to the mystery in Part I. Bit I personally thing that Arthur overdid it.  The style of writing is remarkable. Surely, children15+ can read the book with ease (Kindle and Vocabulary Builder feature strongly recommended.) I learnt around 150 new words. The book is descriptive, unique, debut, enchanting, mysterious, follows a backstory, and informative. Nice reading. The plot really makes you think as if the murders are happening for real.<br/>  <br/><br/>Part I: The Reminiscences of WatsonEdit<br/><br/>Part I leads with a heading which establishes the role of Dr. Watson as narrator and sets up the narrative stand-point that the work to follow is not fiction, but fact: ""Being a Reprint from the Reminiscences of John H. Watson, MD, Late of the Army Medical Department.""<br/><br/>The story begins in 1881,[4] when Dr. Watson, having returned to London after serving in the Second Anglo-Afghan War, runs into an old friend named Stamford at the Criterion Restaurant,[5]who had been a dresser under him at St. Bartholomew's Hospital .[6] Watson confides in Stamford that, due to a shoulder injury that he sustained at the Battle of Maiwand, he has been forced to leave the armed services and is now looking for a place to live. Stamford mentions that an acquaintance of his, Sherlock Holmes, is looking for someone to split the rent at a flat at 221B Baker Street, but he cautions Watson about Holmes's eccentricities.<br/><br/>Stamford takes Watson back to St. Bartholomew's where, in a laboratory, they find Holmes experimenting with a reagent, seeking a test to detect human haemoglobin. Holmes explains the significance of bloodstains as evidence in criminal trials. After Stamford introduces Watson to Holmes, Holmes shakes Watson's hand and comments, ""You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive?"" Though Holmes chooses not to explain why he made the comment, Watson raises the subject of their parallel quests for a place to live in London, and Holmes explains that he has found the perfect place in Baker Street. At Holmes's prompting, the two review their various shortcomings to make sure that they can live together. After seeing the rooms at 221B, they move in and grow accustomed to their new situation.<br/><br/>Watson is amazed by Holmes, who has profound knowledge of chemistry and sensational literature, very precise but narrow knowledge of geology and botany; yet knows little about literature, astronomy, philosophy, and politics. Holmes also has multiple guests visiting him at different intervals during the day.<br/><br/>After much speculation by Watson, Holmes reveals that he is a ""consulting detective"" and that the guests are clients. Facing Watson's doubts about some of his claims, Holmes casually deduces to Watson that one visitor, a messenger from Scotland Yard is also a retired Marine sergeant. When the man confirms this, Watson is astounded by Holmes' ability to notice details and assemble them.<br/><br/>Holmes reads the telegram requesting consultation in a fresh murder case. He is reluctant to help because credit would go entirely to the officials. Watson urges him to reconsider so Holmes invites him to accompany him as he investigates the crime scene, an abandoned house off the Brixton Road.<br/><br/>Holmes observes the pavement and garden leading up to the house before he and Watson meet Inspectors Gregson and Lestrade. The four observe the crime scene, Holmes using a magnifying lens and tape measure. The male corpse, he's told, has been identified as Enoch Drebber. Blood has been found in the room but there is no wound on the body. They also learn from documents found on his person that he was in London with his secretary, Joseph Stangerson. On one wall, written in blood, is ""RACHE"". Correcting an erroneous theory of Lestrade's, Holmes remarks that it is the German word for ""revenge."" He goes on to deduce that the victim died from poison and supplies a description of the murderer: six feet tall, disproportionately small feet, florid complexion, square toed boots, and smoking a Trichinopoly cigar. His right-hand fingernails are long and he came in a cab whose horse had three old shoes and a new one. Holmes says ""RACHE"" was a ploy to fool the police. Upon moving Drebber's body, the pair discover a woman's gold wedding ring.<br/><br/>Soon, Holmes and Watson visit the home of the constable who had first discovered the corpse, paying him a bit for disturbing his nocturnal sleep cycle. They get little information Holmes didn't already know, other than that a seemingly drunk loiterer had attempted to approach the crime scene. Holmes chastises the officer for not realising that this was the murderer himself in disguise. They leave and Holmes explains that the murderer returned on realising that he'd forgotten the wedding ring.<br/><br/>Holmes dispatches some telegrams including an order for a newspaper notice about the ring. He also buys a facsimile of it. He guesses that the murderer, having already returned to the scene of the crime for it, would come to retrieve it. The advertisement is answered by an old woman who claims that the ring belongs to her daughter. Holmes gives her the duplicate, follows her, and returns to Watson with the story: she took a cab, he hopped onto the back of it, he found that she had vanished when it stopped. This leads Holmes to believe that it was the murderer's accomplice in disguise.<br/><br/>A day later, Gregson visits Holmes and Watson, telling them that he has arrested a suspect. He had gone to Madame Charpentier's Boarding House where Drebber and Stangerson had stayed before the murder. He learned from her that Drebber, a drunk, had attempted to kiss Mrs Charpentier's daughter, Alice, which caused their immediate eviction. Drebber, however, came back later that night and attempted to grab Alice, prompting her older brother to attack him. He attempted to chase Drebber with a cudgel but claimed to have lost sight of him. Gregson has him in custody on this circumstantial evidence.<br/><br/>Lestrade then arrives revealing that Stangerson has more recently been murdered. He had gone to interview Stangerson after learning where he had been rooming. His body was found dead near the hotel window, stabbed through the heart. Above his body was again written “RACHE”. The only things Stangerson had with him were a novel, a pipe, and a small box containing two pills. The pillbox Lestrade still has with him. Holmes tests the pills on an old and sickly Scottish terrier in residence at Baker Street. The first pill produces no evident effect, the second kills the terrier. Holmes deduces that one was harmless and the other poison.<br/><br/>Just at that moment, a very young street urchin named Wiggins arrives. He's the leader of the “Baker Street Irregulars”, a group of similar homeless children Holmes employs to help him occasionally. Wiggins states that he's summoned the cab Holmes wanted. Holmes sends him down to fetch the cabby, claiming to need help with his luggage. When the cabbie comes upstairs and bends for the trunk, Holmes handcuffs and restrains him. He then announces the captive cabby as Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Drebber and Stangerson.<br/><br/>Part II: ""The Country of the Saints""Edit<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The Mormon Nauvoo Legion, considerably overlapping with the Danites.<br/><br/>The story flashes back to the Salt Lake Valley (in modern Utah) in 1847, where John Ferrier and a little girl named Lucy, the only survivors of a small party of pioneers, lie down near a boulder to die from dehydration and hunger. They are discovered by a large party of Latter-day Saints led by Brigham Young. The Mormons rescue Ferrier and Lucy on the condition that they adopt and live under their faith. Ferrier, who has proven himself an able hunter, adopts Lucy and is given a generous land grant with which to build his farm after the party constructs Salt Lake City. Years later, a now-grown Lucy befriends and falls in love with a man named Jefferson Hope.<br/><br/>Lucy and Hope become engaged to be married, scheduled after Hope's return from a two-month-long journey for his job. However, Ferrier is visited by Young, who reveals that it is against the religion for Lucy to marry Hope, a non-Mormon. He states that Lucy should marry Joseph Stangerson or Enoch Drebber—both sons of members of the church's Council of Four—though Lucy may choose which one. Ferrier and Lucy are given a month to decide.<br/><br/>Ferrier, who has sworn to never marry his daughter to a Mormon, immediately sends out word to Hope for help. When he is visited by Stangerson and Drebber, Ferrier is angered by their arguments over Lucy and throws them out. Every day, however, the number of days Ferrier has left to marry off Lucy is painted somewhere on his farm in the middle of the night. Hope finally arrives on the eve of the last day, and sneaks his love and her adoptive father out of their farm and away from Salt Lake City. However, while he is hunting for food, Hope returns to a horrific sight: a makeshift grave for the elder Ferrier. Lucy is nowhere to be seen. Determined to devote his life to revenge, Hope sneaks back into Salt Lake City, learning that Stangerson murdered Ferrier, and that Lucy was forcibly married to Drebber. Lucy dies a month later from a broken heart; Drebber, who inherited Ferrier's farm, is indifferent to her death. Hope then breaks into Drebber's house the night before Lucy's funeral to kiss her body and remove her wedding ring. Swearing vengeance, Hope stalks the town, coming close to killing Drebber and Stangerson on numerous occasions.<br/><br/>Hope begins to suffer from an aortic aneurysm, causing him to leave the mountains to earn money and recuperate. When he returns several years later, he learns that Drebber and Stangerson have fled Salt Lake City after a schism between the Mormons. Hope searches the United States, eventually tracking them to Cleveland; the pair then flees to Europe, eventually landing in London.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A Study in Scarlet by George Wylie Hutchinson, (1892)<br/><br/>Holmes manages to lure Hope, in his role as cabdriver, to his Baker Street room, where he claps handcuffs on him, and with the help of Lestrade, Gregson, and Watson, manages to subdue and restrain him. Hope then willingly tells his story to his captors. In London, Hope became a cabby and eventually found Drebber and Stangerson at the train station in Euston about to depart to Liverpool. Having missed the first train, Drebber instructs Stangerson to wait for him at the hotel and then returns to Madame Charpentier's house. He is attacked by her son, and after escaping, he gets drunk at a liquor store. He is picked up by Hope and is led to the house on Brixton Road, which Drebber drunkenly enters with Hope. He then forces Drebber to remember who he is and to take a pill out of a small box, allowing God to choose which one dies, for one was harmless and the other poison. Drebber takes the poisoned pill, and as he dies, Hope shows him Lucy's wedding ring. The excitement coupled with his aneurysm had caused his nose to bleed; he used the blood to write “RACHE” on the wall above Drebber.<br/><br/>Hope realised, upon returning to his cab, that he had forgotten Lucy’s ring, but upon returning to the house, he found Constable Rance and other police officers, whom he evaded by acting drunk. He then had a friend pose as an old lady to pick up the supposed ring from Holmes's advertisement.<br/><br/>Hope then began stalking Stangerson's room at the hotel; but Stangerson, on learning of Drebber's murder, refused to come out. Hope climbed into the room through the window and gave Stangerson the same choice of pills, but he was attacked by Stangerson and forced to stab him in the heart.<br/><br/>After being told of this, Holmes and Watson return to Baker Street; Hope dies from his aneurysm the night before he was to appear in court, a smile on his face. One morning, Holmes reveals to Watson how he had deduced the identity of the murderer and how he had used the Irregulars, whom he calls ""street Arabs,"" to search for a cabby by that name. He then shows Watson the newspaper; Lestrade and Gregson are given full credit. Outraged, Watson states that Holmes should record the adventure and publish it. Upon Holmes's refusal, Watson decides to do it himself.",,,2,0

This is a completely different book and things have changed a lot. You'll notice this at the beginning of the book itself.  The plot takes place on Mona Island towards the south west of Chipenden. The book starts with a quick recap of its predecessor book and how our heroes fought of the Dark Goddess Ordeen in Greece and also the recap of characters and their origin. Let me give you a brief idea of the plot. At Chipenden, the Spooks house and library gets burnt which thoroughly devastates him and marks the beginning of waxing of his power. As a result, our heroes go to Mona Island to escape from the forces of war at Chipenden. There they meet hostile forces of the 'yeoman' and are captured and transferred to a prison in Greeba Keep under the order of Lord Barule.  Bony Lizzie, who also escaped the Spook's prison is now at large on the island. The Spook, Alice, Tom and the Bloodhounds somehow fight of the Shaman and escape the Keep and return again there under the powerful influence of Bony Lizzie as the Spook weakens day by day. Lizzie hopes to become the queen of the island and tries many things.  In the end our heroes finish of the Buggane and the malevolent witch with the help of a powerful alliance of a bird witch Adriana.<br/>  There's a whole new group of characters, locations, spells and skills in the book. Young Apprentice Ward gains a paramount knowledge here. The protagonists remain the same with the small addition of the three hounds Claw, Blood and Bone. The antagonists are Bony Lizzie, a malevolent witch who has escaped the Spooks pit and wants to become the queen the Mona Island and grows ever powerful. She is the major antagonist. The buggane, a dark daemon identity who is a beast and can suck the life force or the animus of living organisms he is the secondary antagonist and finally the third one, The Shaman who is the controller of the buggane but not as powerful but can influence animals according to his will. The yeomen and  'Horn' the offspring of the Fiend are just minions and not a major threat but they give a hard time to our Dark Duelers. Even, characters like Major Stilton, Adriana the bird witch and her husband Simon and the Tynwald Council are side characters that play a minor role in the story. Lets talk about character development. Tom is just the way he was, not a bit better asp compared to the previous novel. Though he has got some more sense of responsibility. He is confused and sometimes scared of Lizzie and the buggane and wouldn't survive if not for Alice.(She is very helpful, not doubt) Even, the issue of the Blood Jar terrifies him. But he's courageous and not meek like he once was. He is able to face difficulties with much more ease and he is getting a lot better at disobeying the Spook and getting along with Alice. I personally think that he has obtained a glorious and a  major role and has sidelined the Spook. Alice has been a lot helpful and saves the life of our young and old heroes a dozen of times. And for doing this, she uses a lot of new and unknown dark tricks. She gains a lot of dark knowledge through he grimore of the Shaman who is slain by Lizzie. She is insuspectable and does not fear Lizzie at all, probably because she is her daughter. Speaking of John Gregory, the Spook he is surely growing old and timid, the major reason may be due to the burning of his library he thinks that he has failed his motive and almost gives up. But he tries to get Tom to do things and seems determined, but gets tired easily. Mark my words, he is still a good teacher but keeps overdoing 'don't use the dark' motto towards Alice and Tom. He has expertise in dealing with the Buggane and tracking Lizzie, though he gets stuck in prison a lot of times, beaten only by Tom.  The buggane is just great, his abilities are frightening and his appearance itself can turn people mad. It plays a major role in the book. I would say it was like a mini-Bane version who can get in the minds of people and suck their life force and can change forms it has got a lot of 'Bane' traits. The Shaman is Lord Barule the ruler of the Island and makes things go very bad for Tom and hi Hounds as he makes them fight against each other and is very malevolent and cruel. But he is finished off early in the book by Bony Lizzie who takes his thumb bones and becomes very powerful. Lizzie then just reaches the epitome of a prime Pendle witch and uses astonishing spells and curses and makes people go mad and kills them with just a glance. She wields powerful abilities to make someone do something against their will and even controlling the buggane for a while. She is finished off by Adriana, the bird witch. I just love Mona Island, it sets a grim and a dark atmosphere for the plot that is completely suitable. Its shores and other locations are very well planned, especially the Grim Cache which plays a turning point in the story, the labyrinth of the buggane and most importantly the Greeba Keep. A lot of things happen in the above mentioned places. They have got a Royal but dark touch and it just adds up to the story. The forest are also remarkable. The spiked barrel rides also deserves a mention.  I really like he book, how the plot is twisting and turning and mysterious, it gives you jumps and rides of terror, action, morals, threats and dark magic. It has got everything that wardstone readers would be looking for. It would be most fruitful if you read this book Immediately after its predecessor and you would immediately notice the difference both in character developments and the setting along with the location. A very enjoyable, delightful, sometimes horrifying, ride full of action and unobvious plot that will leave you thinking. Nice Reading!!",,,2,0

The narration has close resemblance to Christie's writing style. I found myself turning the pages with mounting impatience. The story is pretty lively and the fact that it's novelized from a play is clearly seen. I would just love to watch the original play but the book has it's own glory. Now, this mystery novel is unique in it's own way, the circumstances of murder and its link towards the past and present is quite different, the characters are minimal and the time frame for the story is just one evening. So, you get a condensed and fast paced mystery novel that succeeds in entertaining you in every possible way. I adored the character of Clarissa, her imagination and how she perceives the world. Her cheerful nature turned the story dramatically and added a plentiful of humour to it. Her relation to the fatherly Roly adds greater depth to the story. Pippa, a twelve year old girl is another great addition but I think she's a bit silly for a twelve year old girl. (But the story takes in 1950's, so it's expected) The primary attraction of the book is short and small cliffhangers (or engagers as I would call them) makes the reader read another chapter and go on finishing the book quite quickly, the reader is absolutely hooked with the consistent and the surprising plot. I even liked the interaction between the four primary characters and the circumstances of Henry as a host for the Prime Minister and Kalendorff's meeting added some tension to the situation. The past also links with the present and provides a crystal clear idea about how the crime was done. I especially loved the cheerfulness and the plot twists. There are a few police officers in the story who play a key role and investigate the primary characters, they, I should say, compliment the characters and question them to provide indirect answers to the readers through which it is fairly easy to suspect and decide for certain who the murder was. The story takes place in a house, for the duration of a couple of hours, with around 6-7 major characters so it's very easy to follow and finish off quickly. Do expect hidden personalities, homicide, mild jokes, wine, bridge games, police officers, secret compartments, a haunting history and a very satisfying ending. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

It does not practically show the Science of Deduction as compared to the ""Study in Scarlet"". A good book but mostly with more action and a classic and unexpected back story.<br/>  +Nice Reading<br/><br/><br/>The story is set in 1888.[1] The Sign of the Four has a complex plot involving service in India, the Indian Rebellion of 1857, a stolen treasure, and a secret pact among four convicts (""the Four"" of the title) and two corrupt prison guards. It presents the detective's drug habit and humanizes him in a way that had not been done in the preceding novel, A Study in Scarlet (1887). It also introduces Doctor Watson's future wife, Mary Morstan.<br/><br/>According to Mary, in December 1878, her father had telegraphed her upon his safe return from India and requested her to meet him at the Langham Hotel in London. When Mary arrived at the hotel, she was told her father had gone out the previous night and not returned. Despite all efforts, no trace has ever been found of him. Mary contacted her father's only friend who was in the same regiment and had since retired to England, one Major John Sholto, but he denied knowing her father had returned. The second puzzle is that she has received six pearls in the mail from an anonymous benefactor, one per year since 1882 after answering an anonymous newspaper query inquiring for her. With the last pearl she received a letter remarking that she has been wronged and asking for a meeting. Holmes takes the case and soon discovers that Major Sholto had died in 1882 and that within a short span of time Mary began to receive the pearls, implying a connection. The only clue Mary can give Holmes is a map of a fortress found in her father's desk with the names of Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan and Dost Akbar.<br/><br/>Holmes, Watson, and Mary meet Thaddeus Sholto, the son of the late Major Sholto and the anonymous sender of the pearls. Thaddeus confirms the Major had seen Mary's father the night he died; they had arranged a meeting to divide a priceless treasure Sholto had brought home from India. While quarreling over the treasure, Captain Morstan—long in weak health—suffered a heart attack. Not wanting to bring attention to the object of the quarrel—and also worried that circumstances would suggest that he had killed Morstan in an argument, particularly since Morstan's head struck a table as he fell—Sholto disposed of the body and hid the treasure. However, he himself suffered from poor health and an enlarged spleen (possibly due to malaria, as a quinine bottle stands by his bed). His own health became worse when he received a letter from India in early 1882. Dying, he called his two sons and confessed to Morstan's death and was about to divulge the location of the treasure when he suddenly cried, ""Keep him out!"" before falling back and dying. The puzzled sons glimpsed a face in the window, but the only trace was a single footstep in the dirt. On their father's body is a note reading ""The Sign of Four"". Both brothers quarreled over whether a legacy should be left to Mary Morstan, and Thaddeus left his brother Bartholomew, taking a chaplet and sending its pearls to Mary. The reason he sent the letter is that Bartholomew has found the treasure and possibly Thaddeus and Mary might confront him for a division of it.<br/><br/>Bartholomew is found dead in his home from a poison dart and the treasure is missing. While the police wrongly take Thaddeus in as a suspect, Holmes deduces that there are two persons involved in the murder: a one-legged man, Jonathan Small, as well as another ""small"" accomplice. He traces them to a boat landing where Small has hired a steam launch named the Aurora. With the help of dog Toby that he sends Watson to collect from Mr Sherman, the Baker Street Irregulars and his own disguise, Holmes traces the steam launch. In a police steam launch Holmes and Watson chase the Aurora and capture it, but in the process end up killing the ""small"" companion after he attempts to kill Holmes with a poisoned dart shot from a blow-pipe. Small tries to escape but is captured. However, the iron treasure box is empty; Small claims to have dumped the treasure over the side during the chase.<br/><br/>Small confesses that years before he was a soldier of the Third Buffs in India and lost his right leg in a swimming accident to a crocodile. After some time, when he was an overseer on a tea plantation, the Indian Rebellion of 1857 occurred and he was forced to flee for his life to the Agra fortress. While standing guard one night he was overpowered by two Sikh troopers who gave him a choice of being killed or being an accomplice to waylaying a disguised servant of a Rajah who sent the servant with a valuable fortune in pearls and jewels to the British for safekeeping. The robbery and murder took place and the crime was discovered, although the jewels were not. Small got penal servitude on the Andaman Islands, and after twenty years he overheard that John Sholto had lost money gambling. Small saw his chance and made a deal with Sholto and Arthur Morstan: Sholto would recover the treasure and in return send a boat to pick up Small and the Sikhs. Sholto double-crossed both Morstan and Small and stole the treasure for himself. Small vowed vengeance and escaped the Andaman Islands with an islander named Tonga. It was the news of his escape that shocked Sholto into his fatal illness. Small arrived too late to hear of the treasure's location but left the note which referred to the name of the pact between himself and his three Sikh accomplices. When Bartholomew found the treasure, Small planned to only steal it but claims a miscommunication led Tonga to kill him as well.<br/><br/>Mary Morstan is left without the bulk of the Agra treasure, although she will apparently receive the rest of the Chaplet. John Watson falls in love with Mary, and we learn at the end that he has proposed to her and she has accepted.",,,1,0

This genre itself hooks me up to read on and Lockwood and Co. truly takes YA horror/adventure to an entirely new level. Right form the first page, Jonathan Stroud starts a gripping world building and POV narration by Lucy Carlyle, a character who I very much adore. Turn the pages to the glossary at the end of the book and you'll realize the enormous world setup and the ambitions of the writer for this series, you can tell it's gonna be huge from the first look. The Outbreak of Ghosts in a London/Victorian City with teenage ghost hunters exclusively working under academies to hunt and eradicate them seems fabulous enough but wait there's more. There's humour, action, a rather surprising mystery and the past of the characters which still haunts them. I think the book has layers/levels to it. I noticed a lot of foreshadowing and how things may work out in the future but to be downright honest, you'll be missing some great stories and quotes if you don't read this in your tweens. I think older people may not entirely enjoy this sort of setting with ghost hunting and a few noticeable mockery of adulthood and hence you must pick this series up while you are still young and ready to believe in fantasy. Of course, the character I could relate most to is Lockwood, Anthony Lockwood Esq. of Lockwood and Co, the ambitious youth who aspires to become London's biggest ghost hunter along with his colleagues Lucy and George. He's a bit like Young Sherlock but he has got this subtle 'Jorg Ancrath' like personality and can go to his darkest depth to get things done his way but on the whole he's a charismatic pragmatist who wishes well. The story involves supernatural terminologies on a great extent so if you haven't read any horror before you might want to read a book or two before picking this up. Even though, it's pagelength was more than average I broke no sweat finishing this. It even reminded me of the Wardstone Chronicles at times though there's no similarity as such here. This is indeed a very original and though provoking work by Jonathan Stroud and I'm planning to reading his Bartimaeus sequence too. The character development is evident everywhere. I loved the artwork for each chapter and the cover page was just way too cool. I digged the way Stroud narrated Lockwood and Lucy messing up in the first part of the book and returning to explore Lucy's past story in the following part which offers the readers a deeper knowledge about her traits and wat made her who she is now. To tell the truth, the ghosts weren't all that spooky as you'd wish and Stroud certainly should up his game a bit in that perspective. Make it more horrifying and gory. We can't get enough!! I found George to be the most funny and sarcastic character and how well he can put up with Lockwood. I looked up to the way he left eh sky high agencies and started working alongside Lockwood. Lucy's interview and the following chapters really hooked me. The locations in the book with the haunted house, the Crombe House, Red Room are explored with great and minute details with an immersive writing style which stays continuous and fluid. I regret not highlighting some passages as dialogues from them amazed me a lot. I really liked the way how the story developed with each passing chapter with a thrilling and  highly satisfying conclusion. I cannot recommend this book enough and the sequels better be good or better cause this story sets the Lockwood and Co. hype really high! Nice Reading!",,,2,0

This time, the book recurs some previously​ seen characters as Jacks companion on his way to the Nagasaki port in order to return to his homeland, England once and for all, but things run bad when they are intercepted by Seko Sea pirates and form an uneasy alliance with the Pirate Queen, Tatsumaki. Overall, it was particularly well planned, a lot of twists and turns and plotlines which you cannot deduce. Many secrets and revelations are unveiled which answers previous questions and raises some new ones and generates a very interesting theory. Anyways, the characters in the limelight are Jack Fletcher(Obviously), Miyuki,(His ninja friend) Saburo, (His Samurai Friend), Yori, (Samurai Zen Friend, Very Wise) Tatsumaki, (The Pirate Queen with an ambition to rule the whole Seto Sea) a merciless and ruthless gang of pirates (Tigerhead, Kakumaro, White Shark) and a young disguised girl (Lin Lang). The story has a steady pace, as always. Much importance is given to the rutter and the fact that Jack Fletcher is a 'Gaijin' is very much emphasized by the pirates here. The story begins when Jack sees a vision of an old man who warns him about a returning enemy while our group of young samurais board a ship which gets captured by Captain Kamkumaro (a pirate) and hijacked with jack as prisoner delivers him to Tatsumaki who takes a sudden interest discovering his rutter and threatens to hurt his friends if he does not obey her commands and sends him on various missions in order to gain the upper hand against the Japanese Sea Samurai. That is when Jack discovers his archenemy/Nemesis is back, namely 'Dokugan Ryu' or Dragon Eye and they battle fiercely, this time, Jack gaining the upper hand with his Samurai as well as ninja skills and report the traitors back to Tatsumaki, who feels indebted to Jack and frees him. Jack, through the destructive battle at Pirate Town rescues his friends and gets back his rutter and swords (That feels like a quest) but again he is intercepted by Dragon Eye, who Jack kills and it is revealed that the lineage continues and another person always takes up the place of the Dragon Eye and he can never be killed. Evading and occasionally killing  some pirates, Jack and companions board a small boat and begin their journey to Nagasaki port. So that's it. The rutter is also given much importance in the story with Jack actually beginning to decode it for the first time. Miyuki, Yori and Saburo, even though they are in the plot, seem a little distant and their participation is much less as compared to the previous books, they just keep getting tortured, heal each other and keep getting thrown in prisons. The book gets very thrilling and full of action sequences after 20%, the pirates truly have a murderous background and hurt the young Samurai's very much. emotions like love, anger, compassion and most of all friendship and 'Bushido Spirit' are highlighted and given paramount importance. The side characters like TigerFace and Lin Ling also play key roles in moving the main characters in the story. Many new Japanese words, mostly covering the seafaring technical terms of boats and sailing are seen throughout. I especially like the personality of  Tatsumaki, who is a symbol of powerful and Dangerous women. Some scenes are repeated two times in the book, with the chain of same events happening. Jack and friends really find it difficult to survive the big bad world and its inhabitants and I pity them so much after they have gone through so much. Some new weapons, strategies and other roles are revealed, but as i previously said the key point of the book is revealing the Dragon Eye mystery and revealing the true identity. Also, Chris Bradford gives the readers hope that Yamato may still be alive but banishes it to disappoint many of us. A great compliment to the Young Samurai series which stands out as a unique edition as it contains seafaring and sailing. Recommended. Loved it.  Hope to see that damned Kazuki return in the final book. Very excited. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

In the ultimate book of the series, Jack Fletcher is on the run from Shogun's Samurais(Yet Again) and Kazuki, his archenemy and is on a quest to reach Port Nagasaki to grab a ship that will take him to England and reunite him with his sisters. The book begins after a period of a week from the Way of the Wind where Jack is adrift on an island and believes his friends, Yori, Saburo and Miyuki are dead. Running from the Shogun, he discovers a joker and an entertainer Benkai, a funny and cheerful character who helps him throughout the book and they both run thrown the Nine Hells area to reach a new village but again are surrounded by Samurai when Jack is reunited with his Sensei Kyuzo who beats him up and cuts off his little finger, much to his sorrow. Next, Jack escapes Kyuzo and lands into a peaceful home of an elderly person who teaches his to cope up with his loss of finger, i proves his stance and gives tips about the two heavens technique.

Akiko, from the Iten Ryu and Jack['s most beloved friend. So with another happy reunion, they move on towards Nagasaki but a death trap awaits them where Kazuki has arranged a group of sixty ronin and hacks Jack, Akiko, Miyuki, Benkei, Saburo and Yori altogether. There's a lot of fighting, bloodshed, loss of life and emotional turbulence here. Miyuki, sadly dies here and everybody else is running away to Nagasaki, but before that Jack drives his sword through Kazuki, still failing to kill him. Young Samurai reach the Nagasaki Port and find a Dutch Ship that will take jack to England but Kazuki returns and threatens the Captain to give back jack Fletcher. Jack and his friends get ready to be burnt at the stake but a messenger appears and inform tha the Shogun is dead and saves our Young Samurai​. Jack, surprisingly along with Yoir and Akiko leave Japan, with tears and​  mourning and head for England. That's the end of our Young Samurai series. That was the story and I hope you find it interesting. Here's the review:-<br/>The first part of the book is terrible with all the running and escaping and more samurai's keep flooding up, not entirely good, the story fails except the appearance of Kyuzo and the Paintbrush tutorials by that old wise guy. But mostly the first part is just running and escaping. I like the new character, Benkei who tries to stay cheerful and tries to stay nonchalant at even the most desperate times. It's also funny how he helps Jack and the circus parade, who too play a very important role in a few chapters. There's a lot of hiding and secrecy involved. involved. I don't know why Mr. Bradford framed Miyuki, Saburo and Yori dead without a more detailed explanation, which makes it a 100% sure that they will return to save Jack and that's what happens. Jack gets his neck saved a ton of times, sometimes costing the lives of his friend, Miyuki later. The plot develops slowly.  The book feels like a triad of chapters forming a short story and after filling in the gaps and just filling up 150 pages the story begins. There are 3 appearances of Kazuki, each time ending with a duel and Kazuki getting hurt. The first time is on the volcanic bridge and heavy sword dueling with Jack, alone. Jack, is a little set back as he fails to perfectly deliver​ blows due to his little finger decapitation. Soon, Akiko appears, I mean I certainly didn't see that coming. After she appears and saves Jack there's a lot of emotional feelings. A lot of love, friendship and emotional attachment, helpfulness is given more than necessary highlighting. It affects the readers positively in the end. Moving on to the best part of the book, there's a lot of blood, fire, sword duels, arrows, piercing, suffocation, screaming, praying, healing and death at the mega trap where we see a lot of action and turbulence of power. Kazuki completely loses here. Miyuki gives up her life? Was that necessary, I always liked her. Should have substituted Saburo instead. Anyways, moving on the ring of the sky is revealed near the end. Jack has finally perfected his skills and saved the life of his friends in redemption. The end is just thrilling and surprising. Akiko and Yori also come aboard with Jack. Masamoto teaches a lot of things to Jack and many mysteries are unveiled. In case, you wondered, Dragon eye​ does not make an appearance in this book, that mystery was settled in the previous book.  Many positive and inspiring thoughts, quotes and feeling are highlighted in the book which make it a wonderful read, specially the second half. And we get to learn about a hoard of new terms and words here. Japanese culture​ is not portrayed much in the story. What a great way to end this series, with a massive reunion and and some major character deaths. I'll always remember these characters who have been through so much and risked their life for their friends. This series really puts up morals and values for young generation and carves the mind with gentle, yet fascinating stories that you can learn a ton from. Farewell, Jack and all the young samurai that enlightened my life for the past month. It's really been an amazing, fascinating and a thrilling journey. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

What an astonishing sequel that marks the begnning of the Volume 2 of the young samurai Series after the horrifying 'Way Of the Warrior' trilogy. The setting, plot, characters, learning and arts completely change in the book as if you are transformered to another corner of the world (not really, it's just another Japanese province). Here, our young Hero Jack is on his journey back to get o Nagasaki port but after a hostile encounter he is captured by a friendly ninja clan and taken in for a few days for extra lessons which he would require to 'survive' till the Nagasaki port. There Jack Fletcher, a qualified young samurai finds the village head, the grandmaster, the ninja clan and their arch rival Daimyo Akechi who is bent on wiping out thee ninja clans. Along with the others, Jack slowly learns the way of the ninja and the great powerful elemental magic of the five rings of Earth, Water, Fire, Wind and Sky and undertakes missions and finds the long lost brother of his dear friend Akiko and helps them both reunite with each other. This one was particularly very different from its predecessors as it has a completely different setting and plot, nonetheless, it's a lot more interesting. Jack has gradually become more mature and has understood his position and acts with realization. He knows he's unsafe at every step he takes. Still, after the great opening action sequences at the beginning of the book at the inn are incredible. What better way to start a samurai/ninja book? Later, as Jack finds himself in the village o ninja's he encounters various things that he previously didn't know about the Shinobi and their true nature and behavior. Jack learns a hundred new things paired with weapons and martial arts, but stealth and espionage is given the paramount importance. A wide variety of characters have been unveiled with unique personalities and reactions. The characters from previous book don't appear here barring Jack (That's Obvious) and Akiko who return after a long long time at the end. Chris has displayed his great art of writing here too as he describes the nature and the forest, the action sequences, the missions and the battles very expertly with great eloquent writing. I like the way he uses witty dialogues and philosophical speeches to give the reader a 'Non-Grim' situation even in the hardest times. Here, Soke, an old fellow and grand-master of the ninja village replaces Sensei Yamada who teaches Jack almost everything about the Way of the Ninja and guide him on the proper path. Not only that, he also bestows upon Jack the various skills necessary to survive the long road to Nagasaki port. The haunting memories of the past regarding Dragon Eye and the death of his parents and Yamato still keep haunting Jack. Oh! I forgot to write that Dragon Eye's ninjutsu teacher is revealed in the book! It's Soke, not only that but the complete history and the ascendance of Dragon Eye is also unveiled here. Other notable characters are Tenzo, a 'To-Be' leader, Mizuki, 'a haughty ninja fueled by the ambition to take her revenge on the samurai for killing her parents, exceptionally proficient' and finally Hazo, the long lost brother of Akiko stranded by D.E at the Ninja Village. The thing about the Five Rings of the Particular Elements are going to be way more important in the following books! Mark my words! The book has been aptly named the Ring of Earth as it revolves around hiding and spying and using the geographical area to gain the upper hand. The main quest is to defeat the Samurai Daimyo Akechi in order to eradicate his ruthless rule. It proves to be a good side story but I just wished he would be a little bit more formidable and polished. The first half of the book is just introduction to the 'Way of the Ninja', friendship with Miyuki and the survival tips and tricks, but the magic begins at the second half of the book when Jack is paired along with the other members of the ninja clan and sent on espionage missions to D. Akechi. The missions are very interesting for me and I just devoured those chapters, especially when Jack is held prisoner by the torturer and the rescue party at the end of the book when Akiko is reunited with Hanzo and Jack. Akiko's return really brings me joy because if there is anyone who I miss, it's her. There are new weapons, dialogues, skills and tricks that you surely don't want to miss. A really good, well-planned book with a good story. There are various side quests too! Nice Reading!",,,1,0

It has the most unbelievable plot that you could encounter in a YA (Young Adult) book series. Its is the biggest novel in the series with a page length of 450+ Chris Bradford has done it yet again and taken this Japanese samurai series to an astounding height which has gained my respect and it surely will be a memorable book series which will be on my 'favorites' shelf for a very long time. In the 3rd Young Samurai Novel, the Niten Ichi Ryu students are trained with great skill and efforts in martial arts, sword handling, archery, horshemanship in order to survive a potential political warfare on a large scale that will completely change the balance of power and Jack, Akiko and Yamato must confront their destinies once and for all to attain peace, but are they capable enough to fight the Dragon Eye itself and win against the powerful daimyo Kamakura? Find out my reading in the book. But, to express my opinions about the book in a single word - Unbelievable! Chris delivers the story exceptionally well, with great narrative, thrilling action scenes, a steady pace of story, amazing character interactions, philosophical and practically inspiring dialogues and a realistic and dramatical storyline with ups and downs. The book marks the end of Vol. 1 of the Young Samurai series. There's a hoard of new characters in the book like the 'admired by all' Takuan who is truly a splendid ninja with his great haiku (Japanese limerick/poem) and courteous behaviour but unfortunately is killed by rogue ninjas. Also, his mother serves as a Haiku sensei for the Niten Ichi Ryu but she's not as remarkable. Other Sensei also endeavour to train their students and unleash their optimum capabilities, here Yori is given a lot of importance as he learn a new skill which saves a lot of lives during the Great War and is taught by Sensei Yamada, my all time favorite. The way the story began witht eh trio of Yamato, Akiko and Jack trying to learn about the secret hideout of Dragon Eye and their encounter with deadly ninjas in the forest informs the readers that this book is going to be a lot different and way more interesting than its predecessors. Takuan's entry and his relationship with Akiko really tics of Jack and causes multiple dramatic situations which are very similar to every persons life and adds a 'slice of life' thing to the novel. The combining competition of horsemanship and archery together was also an issue of importance, where Akiko, as always gains the trophy. Emi, the daughter of Takatomi has gained a lot of importance and a lot of people die to protect her by the end of the book. (I'm getting to that!). The 'Benevolent Sword' and the 'malevolent' sword situation is another great addition in the book with the essence of bushido. If there's any character that ticks me off, it's Kazuki, he's still the way he was in the first book with no character development and always persisting bullying behaviour, sometimes, people really don't attempt to improve. He turns out to be a traitor and burns off the Hall of Hawks and marks the beginning of the Great War as the rebellion of Lord Kamakura. A lot of secrets and mysteries that Mr. Bradford left us readers wondering about are revealed in the book at a very particular timing that influences the situation there, like Akiko being a ninja (trainee), Dragon Eye being the same person who Masamoto beheaded, etc,etc. Now, the main aim of the book is to look at the rebellion and war that is arranged by lord Kamakura in order to control the whole of Japan and becoming the Shogun, which he wins in the end, very sad but the whole war and the battles involved in it are delivered perfectly, bar the death of my favorite characters. The rutter has been given paramount importance and deserves the most attention. Also, the Two Heavens sword handling technique is given paramount importance as it becomes the survival instrument for Jack and Akiko. All those ninjas and Samurais and the race of Red devils fighting with each other along with castle sieges and fortifications and strategies just blows your mind off. The way battles are described just takes the level of bloodshed and gore to the next level with a lot of inappropriate violence which may be unsuitable for children younger than 12 years old. This book also introduces the original person who hired Dragon Eye to kill Jack who is the Priest Bobadill, he's also killed, by the way. Jack, somehwo seems to be an amateur and a beginner as he is just kicked off by everybody and sucks at everything but suddenly gets transformed at the second half of the book as he saves everybody from the battlefield, Yori and Jack surely have got some bond between them, though not as strong as Akiko's and Jacks. It's sad news by Tano, Jack and a whole lot of other young samurai are sacrificed in the war, yes Yamato too! But he deserves a round of applause as he takes down Dragon Eye with him. (I personally don't think he's dead. I mean he's invincible). The way Chris has delivered this book with dialogues at appropriate intervals, apt and perfect description of the action scenes and natural environment takes you to a whole new level of enjoyment and thrill and I was always on the edge of the seat to see what happens next. The Haiku's are also entertaining with a hint of philosophy and the magic of words, like bliss and heaven. Just to inform you Kazuki and Jack face off at the end and Jack gains an upper hand. I wonder what will happen next as Japan's under the reign of Lord Kamakura and Masamoto is banished. Life will be hard for Jack Fletcher as he turns to leave for Nagasaki port. A very enchanting, unbelievably twisting and turning book that will amaze you. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

This 'Young Samurai' series has really got me hooked, it is indeed a beuatiful work by Chris Bardford who I owe a lot of things for writing these wonderful story book that never fail to pleas me. In the fifth book,the characters have grown a lot, especially Jack who continues to go through all the trouble adn the hardships but still, determined and without losing hope continues his journey towards Nagasaki, but the plot completely takes a wrong turn here as Jack lands at an unknown prefecture in Japan with no memory of the last two weeks! (Don't worry, he still remembers his name, his friends, the Niten Ichi Ryu and all the things that happened in the past including his training!) but he is in a very miserable condition with all his materials stolen including the ever valuable rutter, the 'inro' gifted by an honourable daimyo, his Black Pearls gifted to him by his loving friend Akiko and finally his master-blaster war swords all stolen and lost. Actually, the book can be easily grouped into the beginning, followed by the search for each of these three items (That divides into 3 sections), the Riddling Monk and Finally the end. As always, Bradford introuces a major of three new characters, but very influential and dependant on the story with a nice and well defined personality that actually feels very real and worldly That's one of the key points of Young Samurai series, it really showcases many human emotions and feelings, each unique in its own way. Here, Jack meets Ronin (which means a masterless samurai in Japanese), who is a Sake (alcohol) addict and regrets his failure at trying to save his father from his murderer. With Ronin, the book also introduces a rogue gang of bandits and the well-known technique of 'Drunken Style' very effectively which I did not predict would happen. Ronin's charcter is very defined, solid and inspiring. He is intelligent and wise, along with strength and geographical knowldege, an all rounder but is sunken low by his sake drinks. He plays an immensly important part as much equal as Masamoto/Yamato played in the first volume. He gives Jack tips and tricks and helps him a lot. Next up is Hano, a considerably younger girl, who is an orphan as well as a thief and branded a 'nobody' by the big bad world. So she is fueled to rob and loot whatever she gets her hands on, but she is benign and an amiable person, very amusing and funny. She also saves Jacks skin a couple of times in the book. As I said that the book can be divided into seperate sections of the search for Jacks items each search is very amsuing, adventourous and mysterious, making th reader inquisitive about what's going to happen next. Well, anyone can die in Japan in the times of war. I especially love the ghost haunting the merchant, the sword duel with Yau Ryu schoolmaster and the duel between a diamyo and Jack of the Game of Go (Like a Tactical Japanses Chess). After reclaiming all these items, the story gets even deeper as Jack recalls his past memories and blank spaces that filled his mind and single handedly manages to defeat the rogue gang who robbed him three weeks later, completely shutting down his progress for Nagasaki and making him go around in circles. I just love the part where Jack's memory fluctuates between the present and the past. Next up, we have our young hero and his friends facing aginst the Mad Riddling Monk whom I just love even if he plays the role of an anti-hero. The way the Riddling MOnk speaks and acts is nice.His prohecy seems wise. The riddles thrown by him as a challenge are challenging! It just adds a bit casualty to the story. This is nothing compared to the end where we see Kazuki, that arrongant little barbarian and Jack's arch enemy and nemesis return, now fully equipped with bodyguards of doshin and his expendables of the scorpian gang. The book has been aptly given the name 'The way of the water' as the end is completely dependant on it. I plan to continue reading. I really enjoyed this book. A hearty read a a solid recommendation to fantasy fiction YA readers. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

While Way of the Sword may seem a bit alien like stepping in a completely different universe, Way of the Sword completely eradicates that mindset and makes you belong to this series and make it your own. Here, the main story follows a quest of the Three Circles (Fundamentally, much like the Goblet of Fire, but obviously the tests are different). Jack, Akiko and others enter the tournament and pass successfully and are promoted in order to learn the secret technique of the Two Heavens from Masamoto himself. Now, various ""side quests"" also keep happening in the book like the training for the Circle of Three, Dreams and Nightmares, Forming  the Scorpion Gang, Ninja Raids by antagonist Dokugan Ryu, Akiko's secret training, and a lot of philosophy classes by Sensei Yamada who I'm beginning to like very much. The prologue of the book was just fantastic and it prepares you to get ready for the story that follows. A larger group of things keep happening throughout the book but obviously the most important is the Circle of Three. I wonder if the girl was Akiko or Sasori in the prolouge and if it was Akiko then who's her godfather and mentor. Now that would make anyone curious! Chris introduces only two new characters in the boom. Sensei Kuzo, who teaches the art of mastering the bō ( a kind of wooden staff) and trains Jack to fight blind using his senses and a new student who qualifies for the Circle of Three. The characters retain their previous traits and Jack develops a lot, not only physically but mentally and spiritually too and has begun to accept life as it is, thanks to Sensei Yamada. Kazuki has been given some importance but not aw much as in the previous book and I truly hate his Scorpion Gang ( what a silly name). The qualification takes are about fighting blind, archery, physical strength and spiritual puzzles. And the Final Circle of Three includes Spirit, Mind and Physical Excursion capabilities and Chris Bradford has delivered all of them in a very unique way. The philosophy has increased a lot here and almost every chapter teaches you a ton of new lessons regarding how to live life and attain peace. There's a lot f fighting and gore and bloodshed and this novel seems like an adaption of Naruto with all new weapons and battle tactics and ninja raids. Dokugan Ryu is really causing trouble for Jack. Speaking about Japan there's a lot of new words unveiled in the story mostly regarding scorpions and various arts which are seemingly easy to remember but the book is not as effective as it was to introduce the cultural history and background of Japan much to my relief and Chris  directly hits the point making the story much more effective and magical. Its wonderful to see Jack grow so much and there are no major time jumps so characters don't get Mich older. The idea of introducing sasori who's an apprentice to Dokugan is unique and just what I wanted but now unfortunately she's dead. The book ends with a faint cliffhanger as the rogue ninja has stolen Jacks Rutter( this object has been given paramount importance in the book. Mind it!) And Akiko and I'm eager to finish off the next book soon. A very enchanting and inspiring story. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

It's the first book in the Young Samurai series written by Chris Bradford, who himself is an expert in martial arts and the ''Japanese'' arts and language. The story revolves around a 12 year old Jack Fletcher, a young lively boy who works at a ship piloted by his father in order to discover the unknown lands in the big wide world. But things turn bad as his ship is raided by Dokugo Ryu, a rogue Japanese ninja and assassin and Jack gets stuck in the very orderly land of Japan and is trained as a samurai and makes new friends in order to gain redemption for his fathers murder. The introduction of the characters is done really well. The prologue was crafted remarkably, it gives you of the brief idea about the outline of the novel. Jack Fletcher is a unique and a very different hero, but a true an an original one. The thing that makes this novel stand out from many others is that it is set in the land of the rising sun, that is, in Japan. After, a few introductory chapters and murder of his father, Jack is transported to the shores of Japan and taken to a dojo, this marks the beginning of Jack learning to be civilized and groomed in Japanese culture. The book gives a lot of historical data as well as information and enlightens the reader about Japanese language, tradition and culture. Mark my words, a lot of importance is given to these things which makes it very interesting as you get to learn some real helpful things from a story book. There's a lot of Japanese words too, like Dojo, Katana, Ninja, Bushiden, Zen and a glossary of fifty more frequently being used. The pace of the story is steady, barring the huge time leaps Chris teleports us readers into. Mainly, the story is good, I'm not saying its 100% original but it's written in a very good way. I found that it exactly resembles the Harry Potter universe, just in a different culture, and without magic, but the fundamentals are just the same. Like Jack being Harry, Yamato being Ron (At the end), Akiko being Hermione, Kazuki being Draco, additionally, the book even has a samurai (there wizard) training university like Hogwarts (here Nin Ryu something.) Therefore, I say the book is not entirely original but don't get me wrong it does not fail, in the least way to entertain you. In the beginning you may feel, these Japanese names are harder than chemical reactions but trust you instincts and read on, you will get the idea of who's who as you continue to read a few more chapters and enjoy the blissful experience of getting enchanted by this beautiful Japanese world. The writer describes many places, natural environments in a very fine detail. It may bore some reader as the writer goes into unnecessary details. The characters, mainly Jack, Akiko, Yamato, Masamoto play the main role in the story along with some selective university students and their sensei (Japanese word for teacher). The story progresses and gets a lot better as our young samurais enter the academy and enter various classes martial arts, sword fighting, wrestling, philosophy, meditation, etc. The dialogues are used economically, but impressively. The book contains heavy weaponry and arsenal including swords, shurikens, star blades and frequent bloodshed at regular intervals. The battle scenes cover almost 30% of the book, mostly including training and friendly battles (not really...) and just grab your attention and make you want to read more. But it's not only about war, its also about human heart, love, a lot of philosophy and the true way of living life. The Zen Sensei throws around some very appreciable quotes which are very inspiring which makes it a good reason to gift this book to younger readers. It emphasizes on some moral values like courage, determination, bravery, selflessness, sacrifice. It is indeed a well balanced book. (Just add some creepy supernatural stuff and it would be just perfect.) The villains are classy and I'm sure some particular characters that will play an important role in the future installments. There's some bullying and beating up involved but it ends in a positive way and is forgotten soon. The characters' personality development is done well in just a period of one book. That reminds me, time flows very quickly and jumps months at a time. This book covers almost 10 months of Jack's life as he reaches from England to Japan and starts training at the latter. A perfect book with good vocabulary, stylish Japanese words, culture, brief history, original characters, immersive plotlines, awesome and really malevolent villains, love, friendship, bonds, sword fights, battles and want for power and honour. A well balanced book that took to to a different place and a different time. I look forward on pressing on the Young Samurai series and I definitely will. Nice Reading!<br/>*Plot*",,,1,0

A very thrilling, irresistable and an entertaining book that is sure to hold your attention. To tell the truth, I read this book after a weeks gap (I prepared for an HP quiz during that week, but lets not shift the focus) so I was a bit unsure about Young Samurai, but tonight after completing the book, I'm very thrilled and entertained. The Young Samurai series by Chris Bardford tells a unique and fantastic story through every book paired with action, witty dialogues, humour, philosophy, war and what not? So, The Ring of Fire starts with Jack trying to run away from the Shoguns soldiers and exhausted finds himself at an inn where he is requested by peasants to help them fight off a bandit horde who raids their villages and lays waste to their fields each year on 'New Moon'/ 'Black Moon' (he is given the nickname) This horde is led by Akuma, a ruthless samurai. Offering food and shelter, Jack recognizes the 'Busido' along with his survival necessities and is willing to help them and tires to form a team of seven samurai's to successfully defend the village. This plotline is amazing and steady and comparatively slow but builds up a wonderful introductory chapters which give us an overall idea about what the story will be covering. It also introduces some moderately important characters like the farmers and the 'Raid Cycle'. Moving On, Jack coincidentally meets Saburo as well as Yori, his classmates from the Niten-Ichi-Ryu who have certainly grown up and asks them to join his quest to defend the village from bandit attacks and they understanding the essence of friendship accept without hesitation. Also, for further expanding the team we meet Hayato, an excellent archer and a strategist and a young samurai as well and Yuddai, a muscleman like giant young samurai who quickly join the team. These are discovered at a labour station and an archery competition respectively. They are soon joined by Miyuki, the ninja girl from Book 4, who has returned to protect Jack. Another character that plays a major role is Neko, one of the girl from the village but much more determined as compared to other farmers and a bold girl just like a smaller version of Miyuki. This chapters bring together a great team that will work together to gain the necessary victory in the future and each unique with their own abilities and talents. The next chapters cover the strategic planning of defending, not at all boring with humour and a lot of explaining in between, it may seem technical but there are many moments which break the tension, so just trust me and pick up the book. Jack, uses the Ring of the Earth ad builds up various defenses and then later,  a small group led by Jack track Asuma's (The Bandits) minions back to their headquarters and burn it down to reduce their morale and rescue some village girls and return them back to their families. There's ice, bears and windstorms in between which builds up a great plot. After returning Asuma's hatred and lust for revenge increases and he attacks the village which after many attacks is unsuccessful and he finally dies, with each attack plunging down his army.  Here, a number of villagers too, lose their life due to their unsteady performance. I just made a long story short. The invasion covers around 10 chapters with three breaks but it builds up a tension where almost everybody gets hurt and tension builds. This is the exact time where the book keeps you on the edge of the seat and obviously there's a lot of bloodshed, war and fire (as the name suggests). The very well-planned book that brings back the most lovable characters and easily paints them in the picture. The story is good, with of course, some great philosophical lessons by Yori. Miyuki seems good as always, if not better and the new recruited duo also play a vast role and build up their own image in just a single book. Sadly, one of them dies at the end. I don't know why, but I just hate the farmers, they get easily disappointed, fearful and always back down and are ready to turn Jack to the Shogun for money even at the end after sacrificing everything about them and always keep complaining. So I hate them, barring Neko, she's just wonderful and technically she's an orphan, not a farmer. Character development is okay, but Jack doesn't seem to get better after spending three years in Japan. Bradford should have allowed him some more advanced skills. A fantastic and a memorable read that explains you about human emotions, war, friendship, love, betrayal along with a lot of action that will keep children and adults alike entertained throughout. Strongly suggested to YA readers and Naruto fans. A textual delicacy. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

He googles the Ravens Gate but finds nothing and gets a chat window with Dr.Dravid who be asks about but Dr leaves. He goes to the Lesser Mapping journalist to buy newspaper but the Journalist Richard asks for his story which he gladly tells but Richard does not believe him at all and sends him away. <br/>    One night Matt wanders towards the forest where he fiends all the village gathered, children and all. Some people unloading a box. Matt touches a trap which alarms Jayne Deverill his cruel and odd fosterer. She magically summons three hounds who chase Matt until he falls in the bog but he is rescued by Richard the journalist.  He teLos him his story and his precongnitive abilities and how he can for see the future and move items with his mind. Richard accepts and they meet the creator of the building where the ritual was taking place.<br/>   Later, they meet Mrs. Ashwood whonteels them to understand the mystery of he ravens gat they must seek Dr Dravid who is a me member of the nexus organisation which keeps the world out of harm.

Richard also helps during these encounters.<br/>   After at his the duo go back to nexus and meet a member of the Nexus Mr.Fabian who suspects there's a second gate in Peru and warns Matt much worse is coming.<br/>    This was probably the best horror and thrilling book I've read. Some things are influential.and the plotlines are good. It seems Matt is peaceful.and no left but is a troubled teen. He has good traits but he is not free and independent. The book has impressive urban and rural narration. The narration is simple with no play of words but the story makes you read on. Horowitz surely knows town surroundings and has used them effectively I. the book. There is recognizable thugging and crimes in the first few chapters. Prkbablzy Horowitz tries to set up a poor.economically backward town. Horowitz also names every model of the car that comes across. Sarcastic. horror is thing in the book. Not much humour but sarcasm and darkness for sure. There's also much of witches witches and odd beasts and paranormal activities linked with Matt's life. The latter half of the books takes you to urban areas which is a downfall. <br/>   ""The medieval witch splits throats. The twenty first century witch splits atoms.""<br/>    A great read And strongly recommended for begginer readers.",,,1,0

But you can definitely rely on the narration and the intriguing and thought provoking writing full of imagery and references to anthropology as imagined and perceived by an unusual character in the society. This book is a bit like the Monster Calls, in the beginning the setting seems simple and plain enough until chapter 3 when reality shifts and the seven year protagonist has perhaps the most confusing and horrifying time of his life but it also involves exploring and enlightenment. The author hints towards the overall personality and behaviour of adults and their false masks really well. There are a lot of things here that could have gone wrong or would have been perceived in a wrongful manner but Gaiman has craftfully written sticking to the though provoking highly imaginative and original plot with wise words dropping and sudden turn of events happening when you least expect them. Hints, references and remarks are at every corner of the page of you look hard enough. The book and the story has an atmosphere to it. I could relate many of my childhood memories throughout the story. Gaiman actually has crafted his narration style to suit that of a seven year old and does not mistake thinking like an adult but delves deeper into the child of the Brian to bring authentic and original wonders about this world. The book has some very serious happenings, dark and grim with some graphic words and actions but this is not something not suitable for kids, matter of fact it is good enough for 10 year olds and up to actually read the book, the message at the end is not only arouses sympathy bit also makes one aware about the mechanisms of life and that not everything works out in the end and that the human being is a morally fractured hit persistent creature of habit and his moral compass can bend towards th good with the correct exposure. A wonderfully written book with horror, mystery, surreal fantasy elements to it. Absolutely loved it. Many parallels from a Monster Calls but this definitely has it's originality.

In fact, I hesitate to read Magic+Romance genre's. Well,matter of fact, this book can be placed in a whole new different genre - phantasmagorical. It deserves it's own genre and all, after all it's the most imaginative, powerful, inspiring, magical and beautifully printed book I've ever read and will read(possibly). As I read 'The Night Circus' in hardcover deluxe edition, my reading experience has been ethereal and divine. (Reading these adjectives, you may call me crazy..Just wait until you pick up the deluxe hardcover edition). The outer jacket is beautiful and illustrious with a fancy dust cover and large length pages. The font and the letters teleport the reader into the imaginative night circus and changes your outlook towards the book. <br/>P.S. : I'm a fan of  E-books and Kindle but I have to say while reading this book just pick up a paperback at least. Now, moving towards the actual text inside the book. The book is divided into 5 parts/volumes with a couple of quotes from characters within the book themselves appearing before each volume begins. The book is unique and original in every sense. The story is told from two perspectives. A past(present) and a past (past) timeline. These two timelines are not flashbacks but events which occur and progress throughout the story meeting each other at the near future and rising to a great height of excitement, adventure and an epic finale, expressed in a single word- culmination. It's wonderful to see how these story lines have different character who meet as the years close in and the resulting effect it has on the storyline. The novel itself covers around 80 years or more. So each 5 pages cover almost a year. Be ready to be surprised at regular intervals. <br/>Right from the first page, with the introduction of Celia and Hector a.k.a Prospero, you know what you're diving into, the introductory part is so very self-explanatory you don't have to sweat anything and can swiftly ease into the wonderful narration of the primary storyline. The story and the characters develop wonderfully and grow older, wiser, smarter and dexterous with each page. Oh, and I learnt quite a load of new words from the book. #VocabularyBuilder.<br/>Each of the characters in the story has a different opinion and perspective towards the 'Night Circus' world due to which there's no monotony while reading the book at all. I can't even begin to imagine the <br/> of Erin Morgenstein while undertaking the task of writing the story. Hats off. What I loved the most about this book is a unique and and original idea of reinventing magic, adding a dash of romance, adventure and suspense to it and make it a bit tragic to appeal the reader and begin the most satisfying cycle of enchanting storytelling. Each and every sentence has a deeper meaning or an essential teaching. The book has philosophical ideas, wise quotes, universal enlightening thoughts and inspiring events dramatized and woven in a great form on narration. The author covers each and every detail which also acts as a foreshadowing factor, in fact the book itslef has a set of diviners, card-readers, stargazing people so do expect a lot of foreshadowing, prophecies and likewise. The magic in the book is so imaginative, Morgstein has a rich sense of magical taste and delivers enthralling content to the readers to amaze. The circus is the primary location for the magical events which unfold in both the story-lines. Turning back time, black and white flames, wound healing, magic rings, mind entrapment, fancy magic tricks, mind-dazzling illusions and a hell lot of spells, enchantments and ghosts are to be encountered and cherished in the book. I just find it amazing how some characters supplement/complement other characters and how they all blend in together within the story. Colour, illustrations and illusions are described in-depth so that the image automatically is visualized by the reader and there is no hint committed. The importance of time is conveyed very well in the book. We get to see at least ten location across the world and how the circus performs in each of theses locations. The romance between Celia and Marco is just undeniably wonderful and addicting. You know that there's going to be a hell of a tragedy while reading each and every page until the climax gets you way too excited. I adore how their relationship develops and enhances. You just have to read it to experience it. <br/>I would say to Erin Morgenstein- ""Imagination, that is your creation."" :D<br/>This is a book that you need to read over and over again to understand the complexity of the characters and the ideologies expressed by the author, because there will be a moment when you'll be glad you discovered something new you didn't when you first read the book. So definitely, worth reading, in fact I recommend it strongly. The book design is also worth a compliment. The Night Circus, for me, has been a divine and and enlightening experience I'll always cherish in my reading career. I'll forever be inspired by the opening lines of this wonderful novel, ""The Circus arrives without any warning....""<br/>I'm at a loss of words right now, I can only thank Erin Morgenstein for giving us this heavenly piece of her work and would urge her to write something more and contribute her enchanting magical narration to this world. Larger than life experience. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

In fact, this was a reread, I had a vague memory of the storyline and I wanted to read the book professionally and understand it better so I hopped into it. The story revolves around a father-son duo with a secret history as they jump form town to town and hunt down the <br/> Vampire-like infected creatures with their allies- the gypsies. The central theme of the book is acceptance of death, that it's an integral part of life. But of course, there's a load of action, horror, thrills, love/romance, wine and a grim storyline. The 'Miorita' song adds an exceptional twist to the book and makes it really unique. Marcus Sedgwicks writing style is simple and straightforward. Should I say, a bit hasty. He doesn't spend much time describing things but succeeds and describing emotions and feelings. The portrayal of a young Peter grabbed my attention right form the first page and his drunkard father added some entertainment to the plot. The grim life of the people in the village is seen from the style of writing. What makes the characters belong to the story is the location and the climate in the book. A recluse icy, wintry village with blizzards and moors can be easily imagined and acts a as a wonderful setting for a vampire story where beasts go bump in the night. We have some pretty scary scenes. There are many secondary characters such as Agnes, Priest, Gypsies, etc. etc. which contribute a bit here and there to the storyline and provides an insight to the lives f different characters. I could relate to Peter's character a lot. Romance is also a major theme in the book with two primary love interests - Agnes and Sophia. This book hooks you, delivers great and truly chilling content, you never know what's going to happen next so it's really suspenseful. Sometimes, the book felt silly, but just sometimes. The illustrations, typography and the print of the hardcover makes it very exciting to read. The chapters are just a few pages long so readers who like hurried, fast-paced story with action and horror should definitely pick up this book. There's a load of philosophical, inspirational quotes and ideas expressed. The concluding chapters answered all the burning questions and bid farewell to the legendary Tomas. The 'Sword' part was also quite good but not entirely unique or original. Also, the author sets up the 'Shadow Queen'  mystery for the readers. The unexpected ending teaser left me wondering about the character's future. A wonderfully written fast-paced novel. Nice Reading!",,,2,0

What I didn't know about the book was that it was aimed for a much younger audience of perhaps 10 or 11 years old. If you read Ven a hundred pages, you won't stumble upon a word that you don't understand- which in fact is a nice thing. The story is written in a simple first person POV narration by teenager Kyle. He imagined some friends in his past and they've come back to seek vengeance from him, but this time as horrible, scary enemies. The book begins with some kind of Armageddon int he world and then the entire thing is just a flashback. The 250 pages in the book cover a time period of roughly 5 hours at the most of a single day and it's fast-paced. Definitely fast paced. The author has laced in quite a lot of hints, Easter eggs and antagonist teasers which makes the reader anticipate it's sequel/ entire series itself. I mean to say, the author writes in such a style as to hint that everything that you're reading right now will be connected to the future books in the series. On a horror scale, I would rate this book as good as Goosebumps if not slightly better, but it really didn't scare me. What I liked most about the book was the locations, character interaction, psychological analysis of the characters and their mind playing games with them. I mean, the story is practically impossible (like all ghost stories are) but this one just crosses the line. How can just believing that a rubber arrow can turn into a deadly weapon actually turns into a metal arrow and kills of Mr. Mumbles. But, this book's entertaining. The most entertaining part was Kyle's meeting with his father and the scenes at 'The Darkest Corners'. I even liked how the storyline connected to Kyle's mother and his Invisible father, this turns it into a hardcore mystery and give the story a serious outlook. Now, Amanda is also another wonderful character that acts as Kyle's sidekick. For most of the part, you'll get to see freehand fighting, a hundred or so things breaking, Mr. Mumbles chasing Kyle and Amanda who fail to escape each and every time. What really freaked me out was the repaired condition of Kyle's home where a big battlestar broke out. I can't really say much because the book doesn't cover a lot of time frame. I really praise the book for putting facts and things in front of the reader and explaining each and every bit right from the beginning and blending some funny, dark and insane characters. Mr. Mumbles was the most boring part, he is just some imaginaries zombie like creature with the purpose to hunt down Kyle just because he stopped being a friend? You're currently at the bottom of my evil antagonists in books list. The swimming pool storyline and it's connection to the past was delightful as well as a bit shaky to read. I really liked the way My. Barry Hutchinson has crafted the story but he just made one big mistake- a dull, boring, ruthless villain . Otherwise, this is a perfect hit. I wish it detected more fan-base. I'm pretty excited to pick up the next book in the series. In the end, there'll still be some burning questions and for that I'll need to read Raggy Maggie. A fantastic protagonist with a haunting past and a yet more terrifying future. Let's see what happens, fingers crossed. I hope that the Williams/mini-bosses in the next book are more entertaining than this, they better be 'cause I just loved the story. The chapter titles and the font style is really freaky.

No Doubt the storytelling is fresh, broadly imaginative, original and unique in all sense. The synopsis of the book itself informs the reader about the adventure involving special 'peculiar' children. (who, in fact are 80-100 year olds)<br/>I cannot place this book in a genre as such, it is a amalgamation of a variety of genres and subgenres that have a much broader part in terms of literature. It's almost been a year since I read a first person narrative novel, but boy does this pack a punch! Jacob's introduction as a primary character in the story is done in a very convincing and detailed way with fashionable but unrelatable traits...<br/>The story flows from one plotline to other gradually and in an unorthodox manner. The story is original and unique, the author is bold enough to add his own imaginative elements into the real world events which add a bit of a surprise every now and then and makes the novel really unpredictable. The real fun begins when Jacob along with his dad moves to the island in Wales and discovers the ruined building. The author has really planned very well and the construction of an entire different universe in a past timeline in coexistence with the present is not actually a new idea, still Riggs bangs it perfectly. The peculiar children, Miss Peregrine, peculiar tradition, wights and hollows(which i relate very much from BLEACH!) the loops and the ymbrynes is just fantastic. Abe, Jacob's grandfather plays a key role and his introduction in the story was also well-written. The author has seemingly developed the story from the pictures he collected and he's doe a remarkable job. The grim and unsettling images are simply an icing on the cake which brings the story alive. There are quite a lot of elements in the book which are very fictous but the author tries to co-relate these elements with history, culture, etc. and does a good job at it too.  The book became a bit slow for me near the middle but picked up speed and interest as it approached the climax, with yet more surprises and thrills. Jacobs adventure along with his peculiar friends involves everything, right from spectating his grandfathers death, time travelling, rowing boats, kissing pretty girls, diving into underwater caves, shooting wights in the chest to saving his friends and the world. The last 45 pages were mind blowing with fast paced action and description of natural elements which went hand in hand in delivering a satisfying ending. I cannot stress enough how the introduction to the life of Jacob affected the entire story. The bok has got it's flaws which will surely be overlooked by it's freshness, originality and surprising turn of events. The peculiar children have a great calibre of performing never seen before things in the future books. The physical appearance of the book was simply perfect and I liked the font, typesetting, added images, beautiful and moving letters and the exclusive interviews and teaser for the next book in the series. A great and eerie universe to delve into. Recommended to young adults. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

He really can write in a varied way, and not just write, I quote him ""While many just learns words, he has learnt to enchant the world with his magic- his words."" Midwinter Blood is an absolutely stunning novel that has seven distinct stories narrating horrifying tales which are interlinked with each other to give a huge picture and a shaking end. I really the physical look of the book, with it's comfy hardcover and spaced out chapters with short beautiful heading illustrations. it's a short book to tell the truth, not more than 150 pages. These seven chilling to the bone tales take place in different timelines, some hundreds of years ago and some even in the near future! The  primary characters appears in each of these stories and dies a horrible death, well, a ot of people die in the book, but apart from that fact, the storytelling is indeed glorious. The writing is very simple and straightforward, some scenes are really plain and that's what amazed me. Even the stark truth hurts and haunts more than a decorated pudding web of woven words. I read most of the part of the book post midnight so I had a strong sensation and appreciation towards the book. Eric's rebirth and each of his life's experience in unique and entertaining to read all the same. Though, I acclaim the book, I surely wouldn't recommend this to beginners readers nor to the mild hearted. Also, it lacks action and spicy dialogues or any of the adventure, it's just pointing out facts. The notable stories are The Vampire, The Painter and Midwinterblood, the concluding tale. The author has some really grand ideas that he expresses in the most human way possible. The king's sacrifice and his last thoughts may appear plain on the outside but I bet, these ideas are bigger than they seem to be. The historical plot twist was a great supplement to the major plotline. You may feel that you're missing the essence of the book with scattered tales that are centuries apart but keep reading and the end will be so sweet and heartbreaking. Even, Sedgwick's poetry skills are highlighted in some of the tales. It's a skill to move people with such simple storytelling, but I can feel that Sedgwick is not in his best form while writing the book. Everlasting romance, grief, society, the world, relations, supernatural events, vampirism, bloodlust and sacrifice are factors which would explain this book in a nutshell. Proceed with caution. Loved it. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

The little prince arrives on Earth from a different planet and meets the narrator who too, accidentally lands in the Sahara desert and so begins the maginficent narration and exploration of the Princes backround. The prince is truly one of those characters in the world of literature that I'll remember throughout my life. The Prince is young, caring, imaginative, emotional, inquisitive and kind, so good that it'll make you cry at the end of the book. (I bet!) The Princes unique and one of its kind character truly steals the show. The prince narrates his own experiences and teaches the readers about vital things in various walks of life. It has strongly highlighted in the book that the children have a more brides and a free minded view towards the world rather than the greedy adults and I completely acknowledge this fact. Mind you, there's a lot of philosophy that you can learn from the little prince and now just learn but apply it to become a better person. The prince is emotional, happy, melancholy at times which has a very deep meaning. I studied the Little Princes character in depth. It has layers and layers, which merge together and provide with a beautiful picture. The dialouges of the narrator as well as the prince are notable, I would strongly suggest you to study this piece of literature than just read it. You'll be amazed. The narrator of the story, I believe it to be the author himself has put up his own character very neatly too. The interaction between characters is great, each line and each page enlightens us, something that nobody bothers to talk about in today's world. No doubt this is a classic. Many other characters also play key role in the plot. Animals and plants have been given much importance. Other than this we also have the Fox, the sheep, the rose plant, the king, the drunkard, the people of Earth who play a small yet a valuable role in the story. I'm amazed how the author has used many simple elements to narrated complicated and rich thoughts and philosophies. Hats off!<br/><br/>{Scenes} - The scenes in the book are distributed chapter wise. Each chapter covers a major and particular scene. There's not explicit language, content or any kind of evident violence in the book which makes it suitable for all ages. In fact anybody between the age of 5-Infinity can read the book. Scenes are mainly character interaction, the description is kept minimum. The scenes have been crafted wittily, each giving a positive message. The end of the book is very emotional and truly broke me into tears, I could feel the cells in my body vibrating. The minor character have been developed very well for particular scenes. The Little Prince is a very innocent and caring soul. The language is fine and captivating, plain and simple yet strongly convincing.<br/><br/>{Locations}- Locations include many planets, asteroids, stars and the Earth. Each location has a unique character that the little prince meets and interacts with. The locations are Rocky described, made clear with illustrations. The author has made use of the locations and delivered an unimaginable performance. Some magical and fictional narratives by the author are very inituative and imaginative. Locations play important part in convincing a particular idea to tell people. Of course, many locations are virtual and fictional but are narrated in a real sense.<br/><br/>{Speciality} - Suitable for all ages. Saying 'Wondeful, Unique, Powerful, Enlightening and Life Changing' book would be an understatement of the year. So, this book deserves to be studied than just be read. I actually took notes and marked passages to read throughout my life and ponder over. Reading this book at an early age with make you matured, and the child inside you will always be glad. In fact the book also gives a message that immaturity and childish behaviour are two separate ideas. The Prince is a very memorable character. The book is intuitive and emotional. You'll learn vital and important life lessons through it. It certainly made me a better person. A quick read. The illustrstions are a great addition too. This was probably the only book in my life which I never was in a hurry to finish. Enchanting storytelling at it's best, enlightens, educated and elevates.<br/>#MAGNIFICENT!<br/><br/>{Notes} - Do carry a highlighted and Mark those interesting passages. I'm sure you'd want to reread this beautiful piece of literature.<br/><br/>{Remarks} - Strongy recommended to all. Enchanting storytelling at it's best, enlightens, educated and elevates.<br/>#MAGNIFICENT!<br/><br/>{Rating} -5/5<br/><br/><br/>*****If possible please check out the audiobook, please buy it or get a free copy @Youtube, it really brings the story alive. I thoroughly enjoyed it. You'll be delighted with the results.********",,,1,0

It revolves around two poor young children who face the odds of life and learn about humanity and importance of joy and merriness in one's life. A hint of supernatural and memorable moral values are highlights.<br/><br/>{Storyline}-<br/><br/>{Characters} - The book has three prominent characters, a brother sister duo, Sam and Lizzie and an old man named Scoorge. Other character include relatives, Ghosts, street ghasts and Christmas Spirits (The Past, The Present and The Future) each having a different and a unique appearance. I love how characters show heterogenity, very different from each other in the beginning and slowly, as the chapters progress, get very much like each other, budding with happiness, helpfulness and joy. In the beginning these characters vices and sins are depicted. Their hatred towards each other is clear but as they come to know about humanity life, their benevolence is awakened and their character begins to transform. Sam and Lizzie's miserable lifestly is truly pitiable, it reflects the conditions during early ages in England and how Christmas brought cheer to everyone. The enitre story takesplace within a few days off Christmas when the town is full with joy. The Christmas Spirits are like mentors, elders who guide our young and old characters, show them life's worth and make them relaize their mistakes and get better. It all is supported by a strong backstory. Many characters are adorable, some scary, some pitiable. I loved humans interaction with guiding Spirits. These Spirits also play a central role in development of story. A very memorable happy ending.<br/><br/>{Scenes} - Scenes in the book are of survival, dreams and merriment. Mostly in the first half of the book characters and their situations are introduced. Young protagonists survival and their lifestyle is highlighted along with Christmas joy in the town. The scenes show interaction with other characters. Houses, towns, emotions, feelings are all described very well in the scenes. Some scenes may frighten very young children as they relate with Ghosts rising up from the graveyard, all of them benevolent. Later on, in the second half of the book, the characters get into action and elate with each other more joyfully. I loved the dream sequence and the idea of travelling in the past, present and future in order to learn about humanity mistakes and worth of human life. It has taught me many lessons and I've realized the value of human life. The ending is very joyful. If you are a sad person who needs some inspiration in life, is so the perfect book for you, pick it up without hesitation. The scenes cheered me up for sure! A very memorable happy ending.<br/><br/>{Locations} - Locations include churches, roads, pavements, graveyards, spring gardens and snowy houses. These locations have been described very well. Some locations are very close to selective characters and play an important part in development of story. But, locations have not been treated as the most important part in the book, just complimentary and delightful.<br/><br/>{Speciality} - The book has very specialities, all of which will amaze the readers. This book, even though is a classical reinvention meant for younger readers can be enjoyed by elders alike. The language is lucid, simple, entertaining and joyful. It radiates positivity, the dialouges are enlightening and philosophical. Surprisingly, the Ghosts and Christmas Spirits are helpful (not haunting). It teaches many moral values and has a lot of wisdom hidden in it. Younger children shoudl absolutely read this novel and treasure it. It tells how you can overcome you hardships through positivity and good behaviour towards others. It also has suspense, emotional trauma, mystery, action, horrors that will keep you entertained. Go for it! I just wish there would be some illustrations. Reading in Hardcover recommended. A very memorable happy ending.<br/><br/>{Notes} - Keep in collection. Best when read at night by the candlelight. <br/><br/>{Remarks} - Suitable for younger readers. Delightful narration. Loved it!<br/><br/>{Rating} - 5/5",,,1,0

I think it's a little bit more gory than Goosebumps books but comes nowhere near Stephen King novels but it's definitely worth a quick read. The characters are minimum, the story is straightforward and easy to follow, there's a victim's diary in the haunted house (nowadays, horror stories just can't be made without those) and your regular children ghosts, possession, hidden passages and strange noises. Even though all these factors an be seen in other horror/thriller books I found the book extremely peculiar in an entertaining sense. Of course, this was an enjoyable read and kept me hooked for the first half. I mostly looked forwardDiary 'Theo's Diary' as it provides a first hand experience of a chilling tale. The author this portrayed the layout of the house in-depth due to which you just can't help jumping into the actual haunting atmosphere. The character development of Ben, Dad and Elliot is gradual but crystal clear. The ending was certainly overwhelming and very much satisfactory. It was really amazing and terrifying to read about the 'Hunting Ground' and the 'Hunting methods' of the past owner of the house. These descriptions and images are really gory, violent and somewhat disturbing, apart from this there's nothing explicit in the book. (If you don't read those alphabetical rhymes). The Janey twist added another entertaining plotline to the story. It is amusing how characters react with ghosts as well as each other. The book demonstrates a variety of positive messages in the end as well so it's definitely worth reading. What I didn't like the most about the book is it's silliness or a bit of immature writing. Some events in the story are practically and virtually impossible. Also the ghosts of young children fighting an elder ghost is not very relatable and feels clumsy. Apart from this, there's the choice of weapons given to Elliot which is disturbing. The primary villain ghost Cullayn is created very well. His appearance, thought process, traits are horrifying and easily scare younger readers. I even loved 'Theo's sacrifice and his flashback edition throughout the book. Recommended to younger readers.

89717,The Haunting of Hill House,Shirley Jackson,"Jackson, Shirley",Laura   Miller,0143039989,9780143039983,5,3.83,Penguin Classics,Paperback,182,2006,1959,,16-05-19,fiction-ya-standalone-and-others,fiction-ya-standalone-and-others (#230),read,"*The Haunting Of The Hill House* by Sherley Jackson<br/>To be honest, I didn't even know that this gem existed until I binged the 'Netflix' Adaption and was totally in for a ride, except the book is totally different from what we see on the screen. By that, I don't mean it's not entertaining or anything on the contrary it is everything a book is supposed to be. Sherley Jackson has a outstanding narrative which makes me put this book on my top reads of the year. The 'Haunting of The Hill House' has an extensive metaphorical scenary and a smooth narrative feeling which almost is a throwback to literary classics that we have explored through the years. Through the first three chapters, I reread multiple sentences and marveled at their beautiful construction which makes you reflect and overthink about how the author uses her gift of vocabulary and delivers a very impacting suite of sentences. Moreever, the book has some really great quotes which I noted down and will soon learn by rote. Right from Chapter 1, the reader is totally hooked and engrossed in this modern yet classical retelling of Dr. Montgue's 'scientific research' and the soon to be inhabitants of the mysterious 'Hill House'. The author is through with the history, the background, the locality of the Hill House which seemed very appealing and realistic to me. Even Elinor's journey to the Hill House, which I'm sure if any other author would have undertaken would seem mundane and a commonality but the first person perspective with Elinor's thoughts and her wild nature really helped me to binge through chapters quickly with enormous fascination and delight. Euphoric, now that I'd found out something I longed for so long I actually read the book in half a day and I'm a bit ashamed about it because this piece of art needs to be enjoyed slowly and steadily with each word sucked in like a nectar. The cast of characters though limited offer a great shift in the storyline as we progress through the book and though many people may argue that these characters don't have much development in the coming chapters, i on the other hand would emphasize a great deal about the overwhelming changes each of them go through with their experiences and hauntings that they face together in the book. A lot of pun and play on psychology, science and the way we perceive horror is often highlighted in the book. My favorite quote from the book is: 'Fear is the relinquishment of logic, it is the willing relinquishment of natural senses. You can either either yield to it or face it but you cannot meet it halfway.' The first half of the book is setting up the characters and the imagery of the Hill House and no doubt the readers can, with ease I guarantee, conjure a magnificent and truly dreadful picture of the Hill House. The second part of the book, the author makes appreciable use of the first half and progresses the storyline rapidly with multiple plot twists and a focus on Elinor. I really was glad that i had watched the TV series first and then read the book as it made me appreciate the ink on the pages to a greater extent than what would have been the situation the other way. The author's sense of imagery, personality, the influence of the past on one's present self, an indulgent narration is worth applauding. The masterpiece is blended with horror rooted in reality, psychology, gothic references and the anthropological distaste of hauntings. I plan to reread this soon enough. Definitely recommended to college/highschool lever readers and above. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

I absolutely loved the first two books but this one was a bit dull. Maybe it's me or the book, I don't know. I mean, its not much good and not very bad at the same time. The Grim Conclusion follows the tale of Joringel and Jorinda, two young children who are troubled souls and feel very lonely and neglected. They go on a variety of adventure and experience a lot of sorrow and hardships. This book is not filled with joy or merriment so better keep your hands of if you are expecting a nice simple fairy tale. No! We have much darker things that will fascinate you in the first half of the book, let me warn you again, this is nothing like the first two books. Nothing like them! The first half of the book is much more good and fantastic than the second half. Once the book is past 50% its just dull and non-grim and non-exciting. I'm sorry to say, but Mr. Gidwitz has failed to entertain me way below expectation level. (I'm Talking about the second half of the book). Anyways, here's the story:- Jorinda and Joringel have to settle with a stepfather and their lonely mother and troublesome twin stepsisters who cut of Joringel's head and accidently his mother eats him as a stew. In turn, Jorinda is called at a ball by a prince and the classical story of Cinderella is retold in a way better and gruesome way that will entertain you. Next, Jorinda is married to the Prince and later Joringle is reincarnated in form of a bird and drops a huge boulder on his stepfathers head who dies and Joringle get back to his human form. Meanwhile, The Stepsisters try to persuade the prince to marry them and cut of their heels to fit the shoe perfectly but Jorinda is married instead and later regrets it. To get back Jorinda, Joringel goes through a lot of adventures and mishaps, (One of them includes visiting Hell and meeting the Demon to bring back Jorinda to life) and is guided by the three ravens as always. Ravens have acquired a huge importance in the Tale Dark and Grim series. A chapter is there, where the Sleeping Beauty is retold but it does not connect well to the main story. The plot goes very well and there's noticeable humor in the first half of the book but the second half of the book just loses the magic. It becomes so poor and monotonous, What can I say? Some characters recur back like Eddie, the humangous  salamander, the Devil and his grandmother. There's this one event where Jorinda and Joringel meet Adam Gidwitz in New York City and the Story is retold wasting a few pages. I don't know why he did that. The story loses the magic. Anyways, a book that ad a potential and could have done a little bit better. But Remember, the first half of the book was beyond imagination, it was heavenly experience. Just Great. It's your decision to read or not to read, but I would recommend you should. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

But this one was beyond imagination. A tale dark and grimm is an adaption of Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales. This book has been centered towards Young Adults. I have no doubt that the adults would enjoy it but the children below age 7 should not be given this Dark and Grimm series, it would surely terrify them. Adam Gidwitz may probably the first person who could easily blend in violence, gore, horror, mystery and other aspects with Humor and Fun. The way he criticizes classic fairy tales as not being dark and grim is so true. <br/>    The first book in the series follows the adventure of Fairy Tale legendary children Hansel and Gretel, the much popular brother sister duo as they explore the big bad world and encounter demons, witches. dragons, Devil and blood thirsty cannibals. The story kicks off with an amazing preface by the author which sets up a good enviornment and provides an introduction about what's to come. Then we have around 11 chapters spanning about 20 pages each. The salient and the most admirable feature of the book is how the author sets up the character, the environment and the plot and adds some of his own comments to blend in the humour and also to provide a scare. This way, the book does not become monotonous and provides a means for interaction with its readers. Through these comments, the author convinces his feelings, thoughts, jokes, spoilers and scares the reader. Additionally, he allows the reader to gain experience from the mistakes of his characters. But don't get me wrong, the story is fast paced with a lot of action and humour. This is the jist of the story:-<br/>The King steals a Queen and is saved by Faithful Johannes ( A wonderful character, throughout), because of the prophecy of the three ravens.  Hansel and Gretel are born and slaughtered by their parents to revive Johannes and in turn are revived by Johannes. They escape the castle and are nearly eaten by a cannibalistic baker woman whose house is made up of Pastry. They talk to the fiery sun and the child eating moon and the kind stars. They journey to the crystal mountain and Gretel cuts off her finger and uses it as a key to open the magic door. Hansel turns into a beast and is been shot at and skinned and gambled away. He dresses up like a Devil's grandmother and chased back by the Devil Himself and holds Johannes as he dies. The duo catch up with each other and return back to their Grimm Kingdom and discover that its being haunted by a dragon and make it drunk by giving it wine, just to discover later that it was their father and kill him off but revive him again after killing the beast inside him. They are declared King and Queen. Not that this would be so surprising when you read it in a review but trust me and give this book a shot. Some stories are really horrifying and very descpiable but some are very mild and pleasant. The first half of the book struck more interesting to me because of dark and hardcore action and gore as the characters settled in. The second half of the book follows a laid out and definite storyline that is both surprising and has a ''Good Ending''. Almost everything in the book is impossible and unpredictable. (After all, its a fairy tale)! Sun, Moon, Stars have been personified, KIng's head is cut off and brought back by a magical twine, there are cannibalistic baker women and warlocks, the devil is childish and is followed by his grandmother, the dragon is drunk, Hansel turns into a wolverine, the images and the punishments in hell are s vile, the crystal mountain unlocks with a chicken bone or a finger bone! The story will not fail to amaze you and the author consistently interacts with the readers. A wonderful beginning to a series that will enchant everybody and anybody. Just not very young children. (You keep your hands off this book, kiddies!) A delightful experience. Just hop onto your bed with a blanket and you'll finish it in one go. And of course, I'm going to continue the Series.<br/>Nice Reading!  &#x1f606;",,,1,0

In the second book of the horrifying and humorous series, we follow the adventure of young Jack and Jill. (Yes! From those poems But a whole lot different) <br/>The story and the chapters are more consistent. The first three chapters introduce the main characters of the book namely, A frog whose name is Frog, a young princess who adores her Mom named Jill and a young boy who is left out called Jack respectively. These chapters serve as a very good introduction along with belly-clutching laughter. Some scenes are really humorous and gross at the same time. The author, Mr.Gidwitz writes very naturally and once he has written something, he does not erase it off even if its wrong and turns it around into a joke that will make you laugh out loud. And if  you think its only about humor, then you, my dear friends, are completely wrong. Let us not forget that this books include a magical bean which grows up to the sky when planted and takes our young adventurers to the Giants' Hall where they dine and vomit and cut themselves in half and flood their own halls with blood and vomit and Jack and Jill escape this gruesome vomit pool by swimming swiftly. Also, the Mermaid tale is enchanting and seems very real. Not for the light hearted at all. One unique feature of this book is that even though it adopts the ideas from Classical Fairy tales it emits its own magical sensation that the author delivers with his applaud deserving interaction makes this book worth reading and remarkable. Next up, we have Young Jack and Jill meeting with the Others and go on the quest to get the All powerful Looking Glass (That's the mirror for you!) from the depths of Earth. So they get caught in the Goblin Kingdom and sent a hundred thousand feet under the earth where they meet a huge volcanic fire breathing salamander  called 'Eidecse Von Feuer Der Menschenfleischfressende (German for the Fire Breathing Lizard that Eats Human Flesh). What can I say? THis is perhaps the most interesting or noticeable chapter in the book with all the pandemonium, dialogues, Jack and Jill entering the intestine of the Salamander and getting burnt in the acid and retrieving the Looking Glass.  They return to the Others and become a victim of blood ritual but escape with the mirror, framing the Others. Finally, the book teaches us a lesson and imbibes into our minds a strong and powerful memory that magic exists in the form that you believe it exists and that you must always realize about yourself and act like yourself. <br/>Unlike the previous book, the author silently teaches the readers valuable life lesson (Don't get me wrong, it's still full of horror, gore, blood, paranormal and vomit.) A delightful book to read with a happy and nice ending that our characters deserved.  There are many things that you will be amazed to read left out of this review It makes you laugh and learn and shiver at the same time. A perfect blend that you can devour through your weekend. The characters are amazing, a Frog with Three Legs who can talk (Don't ask me, Its a pretty long story), a young prudent girl who strives for attention and a young adventurous boy full of dreams roaring through the Kingdom of Giants, Goblins, The Others and a whole load of other fantasy creatures. One of the best series I've ever read. Wonderful Work. I forgot to mention, the Chapter Heading Illustrations are worth noticing. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

The plot begins with Susie (Who is getting bit by bit into the spotlight) as she forms her own 'Famous Five' Society and try to envy the Secret Seven by framing up a fake suspicious mystery to fool the Secret Seven that turns out to be true as a coincidence. The story is original and unique and has its ups and downs but  to define it in a single word, I would say it was extremely unrealistic and coincides a lot with plotlines. There are three 3 lucky coincidences that seem too good to be true. The first one is the password of the SS Society matching with the Cheeky Charlie villain. The Second one is discovering the fake mystery turning out to be a real one. And the third one, the Zeb and Larry guys of the railway management turning out to be the criminals and without even a hint of suspicion declaring their plan indirectly to Peter and George of the SS Society. This was the most simple o f the adventures so far. And always, the mystery is regarding robbery and stealing, which may add up to the monotonous atmosphere but don't take the wrong meaning. This book is written very nicely, with witty dialogues and twisting storyline that you surely can't guess. I liked the end very much, it was delivered fantastically as always.

Peter and Janet are believed to be the most important SS members as they actually become victims to the crime of car theft and find important clues easily. The main story begins immediately after Susie's pranks. The book also gives a heavy recap for first time readers. The line ""We haven't had meeting since ages"" has really become so dull and monotonous as we see it in every book! Lol! Its a short and sweet book with some misleading and leadings as well. Also, the SS find out the thief by tracking the suspects with their address and contacts. Peter takes the role of a true leaders and appoints the SS committee for doing various tasks. A hint of character development and story building is also portrayed. Overall, as fair as expected. Nice Reading!!&#x1f60e;&#x1f607;&#x1f64c;",,,1,0

In the beginning I was unsure about starting with Enid Blyton, but now I'm gonna continue and finish off the entries series within a month easily. The beginning is done very well and the introduction of the characters too. It builds a suspense and as the mystery isn't very difficult to comprehend if makes a good children's deceiving collection.

Even if it's a children's book, there's a realistic atmosphere seen throughout the book with a well defined and crystal plot. Also, I personally think that it was a bit bigger than the other SS books and wonderful too. The plot is like this:-<br/>As the SS meeting shed is under repairs, the secret seven group discovers a nearby cave that is away from the masses and a very good hideout for conducting the meeting but they soon discover that things start getting stolen from their secret hideout and catch a trail of criminals who steal the valuable mailboxes. The SS gang is really jolly and happy in the beginning and they set up the cave very well, with all their cushions, books, eatables and drinks. I think one big mistake Enid Blyton keeps on doing is introducing ''theft'' every time as a a crime. There's no murder, suicide, etc. Why is it always robbery? The plot is steady and moves at a pleasurable pace. There are some flaws in the book but I mostly like it as it is realistic. It would be much more better, if the antagonists or the criminals are introduced a little earlier and their character is suitably built. Anyways, a great addition to the SS series.

The Secret Society is really doing some great job. Hats off! This one was a lot better than its previous counterpart. The plot is something like this. As the summer heat approaches, the secret seven build a fanciful treehouse to escape into pleasing shades and coolness with drinks and biscuits. The secret society soon discovers a strange boy along with his cat who trespasses into their domination and they soon get to know about the boys Uncle, who always indulges in crime and get some puzzling clues from the boy. But, in the end, as always, the magnificent society cracks the case yet again and prevent a ''Post letter robbery'', yes, you heard it right! A post letter robbery. Half of the book just goes into building the treehouse and  discovering the stranger. The case comes up after around 50% of the book with a lot of merrymaking in the beginning. Anyways, the crime is very odd here. I couldn't believe that they stole post cards. Some of the clues are MKX, red pillow and Emma Lane, some are just confusing words which have been altered but the Secret Seven get back the right track and unveil the mystery.

Here, the young Secret society embark on an adventure o find the costly pearls which have been stolen and they visit a circus and find confusing clues that they cannot put together and search caravans, trees, buildings and investigate and help the police to finally find the thief. Its a small story, written in a simple manner, which is Enid Blytons speciality. The characters have retained their characteristics and have grown a little mor experienced, though it takes a bit of time for them to come to a strong possible conclusion. The story was amusing but falls short to impress the reader at some points. We see Scapmer, the dog, only in the beginning and later he is missed out. Some features of the novel are the Red Indians game and the Circus crew and location, which play a very major role in the second half of the book. The book rather builds a good story but fails to build that 'Suspense' atmosphere! The progression of the book is nice, but predictable. A good adventure novel with an interesting story.

I'm so glad to read this SS story as it does not have the monotonous robbery crimes, instead it has a sweet and a happy ending similar to the last one and the person who does a small crime is a juvenile and a jealous school girl. The secret seven do not exactly solve the complete mystery and it was just some kind of absent minded search for a trail but in the end Peter identifies our lost girl very well thanks to her brother Charles. Comparatively, this book was generously written with a brilliant beginning and a wonderful end. The interval was dull and consisted of blind search and pranks by Susie. Even the idea if horses and stable is entertaining. A wonderful and a unique read from the Secret Seven Mystery Series. Blyton delivers simple and original ideas. Nice Reading!",,,2,0

I like the way how Enid Blyton had taken her writing skills to a very new level and of almost feels as if you are reading Children's Sherlock Holmes. He writing is simple as always with a steady plotline. Another minor character explored here is Binkie, who's Susie's friend and they both play an important role in creating menace and sidelining the SS society from their tracks. The pie selling woman and her family play a key point role, especially her husband and son who get involved in a robber but for a benevolent purpose. The end was quite surprising and impressive.

I really liked this one as it stood apart from all the other books and reminded me of the first SS book, as the crime done here is the robbery of animals, particularly the pedigree breed to dogs. A very interesting story with a sense of seriousness in it. Things get really bad when a mysterious stranger deliberately exiles George from the SS Society on the basis of shadowing practice he keeps doing in the night. Its the first time the SS gets divided. Also, Scamper the loyal dog becomes the loyal seventh member of the SS temporarily. The story flows at a fixed pace with many things happening but at the same time, the simplicity in the story is retained. I like the way how Peter, takes the lead and has truly become the chief of the SS Society and finds out clues and shows his bravery and courage and leadership and finding the true villain and demonstrating the wits of the SS. Also, as the end approaches, you can vividly see the lines being joint and the jigsaw puzzle being complete. Many, side quests like observing, memory and shadowing are also involved.

Actually, I read the Comic Book Relief 52nd Edition hardcover so it was fun reading. The introduction is brief and informative. It really breaks the barrier between the Muggle World and the Magical Universe. It seems as if it's written by real wizards for us humans. Yes, it's that convincing. Next in the forward we have Dumbledore instruction for using this book as well as Newt Scamanders informative and enlightening historical Chronicles of beasts, their types, etymology, classification and how this book came into being. The book is actually owned by Mr. Harry Potter but is scribbled by Ron Weasly and mind you, he has some really funny comments in the book. The primary feature of the book is the alphabetical encyclopedic listing of magical beasts in the universe. Their habitat, lifestyle, food, interaction with magicians is given along with the 'Danger Rating'. The font is nice along with illustrations of some magical creatures. Ron has also edited some notes with his own comments through his own novice experiences. The magical beasts recorded are quite wonderful, beautiful, fearsome and sometimes distgusting. Their native place, appearance and contribution is wizard world is given through short notes. A footnote is added at required places appropriately. I found some beasts very enchanting, the dragons, basilisk, dementors, hippogriffs, centaurs, unicorns and merepeople who make appearance in the original Harry Potter series. Fans of the wizarding world can relate a lot with this book. Truly, a great reference guide for Harry Potter fans. I was delighted to read this.

On Good Friday, 1612, deep in the woods of Pendle Hill, amid baptismal pools and low, thick fog, a gathering of thirteen is interrupted by the local magistrate. Two of their coven have already been imprisoned for witchcraft and are awaiting trial, but those who remain are vouched for by the wealthy and respected Alice Nutter.<br/>Shrouded in mystery and gifted with eternally youthful beauty, Alice is established in Lancashire society and insulated by her fortune. Yet she is also plagued by rumors of a dark and torrid love affair with another woman, the matriarch of the notorious Demdike clan. As those accused of witchcraft retreat into darkness, Alice stands alone as a realm-crosser, a conjurer of powers that will either destroy her or set her free.<br/><br/>{Characters}- What can I say? The book is full of despotic characters. The most bearable is Lord Rodger Nowell. Everybody else is...! Corrupted dark demons, worshipping the devil, exploiting and assulting the children and old hags. My God! The book is so full of ugly characters. But nonetheless, you'll fall in love with the story and say 'Gross! Eww' etc. Etc. As you get to know the characters. But most of the characters are witches and constables. I liked Alice's character and how she is actually innocent but gets sucked into the witchcraft. I adore Robert Nowells honest and sensible characters. Everybody else is just messing with each other. Full of violence, swearing and exploitation. Amazing! But, there's a deeper hidden meaning within each character. You'll love it. Kids, hands off!<br/><br/>{Scenes} - OMG! Each and every scenes in the book made me shiver. That's the truth! Scenes are either scary, describing the Pendle hill, telling haunting stories, creeping the hell out of somebody, killing, maiming, spilling the guts out, life at makeshift prison, pschopathic behaviour, explotiation and a lot of adult and explicit material portrayed in a ghastly and gruesome manner, very entertaining. The scenes compliment the story very much. After reading the first line I knew I'd be hooked up with the book. Very serious novel that you'll remember and not recommend to anybody not because you don't like it. (You'll love it! I bet!) But because of the content. Ghastly! I repeat, ghastly. Many secondary characters play a quite important role. The ending was way too bad. I can't imagine that happening even in real life. The plot moves at a rapid rate. Chapters are short. The story just blows up!  Some dialouges are way too good. Just love 'em. <br/><br/>{Locations} - Primary locations include Pendle (the witch country itself, no description needed), Malkin Tower, Read Hall and Villas. This book reminds me a lot of The Spooks Battle (Wardstone Chronicles #4). Many characters are similar, the book is based on actual events with actual characters with actual scenes that happened. (I don't believe it!) The locations truly enchanting you. <br/><br/>{Speciality} - Short chapter, variety of characters. Symbolizes in depth aspects of religion, witchcraft, political and diabolical vices. Has strong language and violence. A psychological and dark thriller. A chilling short tale with a very sad ending. <br/><br/>{Notes} - Causal narration style but very thrilling. A lot of explicit content and profanity. Not suitable at all for young readers. May cause psychological disturbances. Should be read within a day or two easily. <br/><br/>{Remarks} - Loved it! Finished within a day. <br/><br/>{Rating} - 4/5",,,1,0

My reaction after reading the final line of the book was ""Unbelievable"", truly, this book surprised me. It's the shortest of the Starblade Chronicles, just 312 pages. I could easily finish it in a day and a half. This book seemed more like a 'Grimalkin' book rather than Thomas Ward book, but nonetheless the contribution of both these characters as a protagonist is undeniable and remarkable. Grimalkin seems benign now, not that she doesn't like blood and Gore but just that she's always willing to lend a helping hand to her alliances, is trustworthy and compassionate towards humans. And she's Dead. There's one thing in the book that surprsied me the most. The characters I thought were alive are Dead. The the characters I thought were Dead, seemingly are revealed to be alive but just within a few chapters are revealed Dead. The characters I didn't think would die, have died terribly...What can I say? This is more complex that GRRM! Anyways, the book is delivered to the readers in a bright fashion with a strong and bold first person narrative. It enchants you and let's you dive deep into the story. Moreever, this book felt much more fun a 'Spook's' universe than other books in the Trilogy. We even got to visit the Dark Dimension as Grimalkin is now Dead, her journey and God-killing adventures in the dark portal are something to look out for. The book is rather impressive with eh culmination of character development and almost everybody achieves a skill that they didin't posses earlier. eg. Tom, Alice, Grimalkin. The book is melancholy at times, we see the deaths of many primary characters such as Jenny, Bill Arkwright (he was Dead, anyway), Grimalkin, Lukrasta, etc. The first half of the book was more intense and took place in the County itself, The Spooky band went on to adventure and deal with the creatures of the darkness, it was a lot of fun to have Arkwright back, the whole skelt and 'imposter' thing was surprising, at least to me it was. I'm glad that the author hasn't put it another army battle, I just can't tolerate another one. But alliances within the dark domain, the God-killing part, Grimalkins terrifying dark Assassin form, Thomas Ward's love for Alice, Jenny's death, Talkus' and Lukrasta's death were some other important highlights throughout the book. Truthfully,  the story is steady, the plot enchanting is enchanting and the overall premise of the book is addicting. There are many layers introduced by the author regarding a particular character. It's wonderful to see the evident change in the characters at the end of the book. I don't know why Mr. Delaney has killed off Jenny, killed by the poison of a water with? (Unbelievable!) I just love the way how the book concluded, the final 20-30 pages went beyond my expectations and the reading experience was thriving powerfully. The author is very creative regarding building up the story, it's fun to read and involves you a lot. There are quite a lot of plot twists. The Alice-Lukrasta endgame really shook me, but all's well that ends well. The Kobalos threat doesn't seem so eminent all lf a sudden. Also do check out the Kobalos Glossary  along with handwritten notes by Tom, Nicholas and Grimalkin, its worth a look. Tom's final lamia form was unexpected. As I said, the essence of the book is surprising , entertianing and thirlling, way beyond my expectations! I love the cover art. Strongly Recommended.

The book picks up where it was left off in its predecessor. It <br/><br/>wasn't at all surprising to know that Thomas Ward (Tom), our apprentice was revived. Of course, we are not reading Game of Thrones here where Martin kills off our primary characters. So, yeah, Thomas <br/><br/>Ward is back alive and seems pretty well. I would just like to pass the message that if you are taking up this series it would be  a lot better if you'd just finished the Wardstone Chronicles first. There's <br/><br/>something called as ''Connecting Link''. So the story of the book mostly takes place in the northern islands, the land of Kobalos. Grimalkin (The Witch Assassin), Tom (The County Spook) and Jennifer <br/><br/>(Jenny, Tom's Apprentice) try to form alliances in order to wipe out the savage Mages, warriors and demons of the Kobalos. And guess what? Lukrasta and Alice appear out of nowhere and help in rallying <br/><br/>the forces and assist Tom in surviving. There's some imprisonment where the Starblade comes into action and Tom doing some spooky stuff with Kobalos ghosts in the castles and rallying the soldiers and <br/><br/>battling the horde of the demon army. The book concludes with Tom, Alice, Jenny, Meg (Ya! That bloody lamia), Grimalkin and Pan fighting against Golgoth, the old god and saving the County from <br/><br/>immediate threat. Well, Grimalkin dies in the end, seems unbelievable to me. Well, Tom died in the first book, he was revived, now it's just Grimalkins turn. Okay, the plot is done, here are my opinions. <br/><br/>The book has a steady pace, a fast and furious plat, a full fledged battle scene, spooky ghosts in huge castles, a hundred horrible ways to die, enemies and alliances, Old Gods and some recurring characters <br/><br/>that make an appearance and surprise you. The central theme of the book is to delay the uprising of the Kobalos race and fighting off hordes of the demon army, but readers! It doesn't end here, there's a <br/><br/>lot more character development and sub story arcs. First of all, I like the idea of how Tom was resurrected and Grimalkins theory that it could be the combined effort of Lukrasta and Alice. I also love how <br/><br/>the author has converted his mistakes into a boon in the book through Alice's explanation of why she had to join the dark mage Lukrasta, it seems very convincing when she narrates it to Tom. Jenny, as <br/><br/>good as ever fails to grab my attention for too much time. What can I say? She has become a secondary character, mind you, she is so good but still I wonder why the author is not giving her enough attention. In fact, Tom is not the only primary character here. Credit is due to Alice and Grimalkin as well, more in fact. Grimalkin just gets better, her battle skills and all that...but i hate the fact that she <br/><br/>manipulates Tom but provides him with strength at the same time. I was so surprised to see Lukrasta die.(He had that coming) But what surprised me most was Alice's return, the book seems so much like <br/><br/>the older books, Alice just brings in the relative feeling and cheers up Thomas Ward. The starblade plays a central role and it's  of utmost importance in thwarting the forces of darkness. There are some <br/><br/>many new concepts to be explored in the book such as the Earth Witch, the Kobalos army, some new battle tactics and other things that you should totally read about if you are a hardcore Wardstone <br/><br/>Chronicles fan. I like the concept how the author gets about the story and delivers an excellent and involving narrative. There are some minor flaws in the book, but I didn't consider them when reading, I <br/><br/>was totally engrossed. Should i dare say that the battles scenes are gory and full of bloody horrors. I was waiting for the hero crew to leave Kobalos land. It's exciting to see Alice and Tom back together and <br/><br/>their interaction jut blows my mind off. There's a great cameo appearance of Slither and the rebellion movement of the Haizda mage. I liked Grimalkin's  tactics in battle, but nonetheless, the human army was just doomed to lose in the enemies courts. Grimalkin seems very different, she's limitless and has a lot of perseverance. She just never gives up and that's gonna take a toll something. (i feel it coming, I feel it coming...). The nasty Witch assassin may be an ally but she is indeed dominating. The real fun begins when the heroes return back to the County. There's a bloody dark case that Tom solves along with Jenny and discovers that the portal to the County is being opened by the Mages and Golgoth is being teleported to the County and people are being splattered into piece. Much of the action happens here. The evergreen places such as Caster, Pendle, Chipenden and Angelzarke Moor are introduced yet again int he book. The fight in the end where Grimalkin dies fighting Golgoth is  just amazing, Pan also makes an appearance. I hated the part regarding human princes, rallying the armies, war strategy and politics in the castles. They just took away all the 'Spook' atmosphere. Anyways, a nice book that gripped by attention. Many surprising events are just icing on the cake. I pity the characters, there is just too much coming up for them, I can't say everybody will survive. The book seems convincing and enchanting. Strongly recommended to people who enjoy other Spook stories. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

The story continues where it was left off in the final book of the Wardstone Chronicles, the Spook's Revenge, after the battle at the Wardstone and the death of the greatest <br/><br/>Spook throughout history, none other than my favorite John Gregory. To be precise, this book is an aftermath of the Wardstone Chronicles and the tory begins after six months of Gregory's demise. This <br/><br/>book was amazing, comparitiviely longer by fifty pages as compared to the regular spooks books but totally worth it. The narration is split into two parts, One narrated by Thomas Ward (Tom) who has <br/><br/>become the Chipenden Spook and the other by Jennifer (Jenny), Tom's apprentice. The story begins in an unexpected manner, not many things have changed but Tom seems a little weak after the passing <br/><br/>of his master and attempts to obliterate the darkness from the County by banishing ghosts, witches, ghasts and things that go bump into the night. The first five chapters provide a great introduction to <br/><br/>uninitiated readers. The characters, locations and the plotlines are explained remarakably and in a very simple manner. The storytelling is clearly depcited and it can be easily seen that the writing style is <br/><br/>aimed  at young adults. So the story kicks off with Tom emancipating a female ghost who has been killed by an unknown race of demon who is later found out to be a mage (another word for wizard) of the <br/><br/>Kabalos creatures, it will rring a bell if you've read The Wardstone Chronicles Book 11, 'Slither's Tale'. Discovering this, Tom takes enny as an apprentice,  tests her, trains her, scares her and takes her along <br/><br/>with Grimalkin to the northern Isles of the Kobalos to stop the invasion of the Demon army into the County and prevent the carnage and enslavement of humanity. That's the story in a nutshell. Anyways, <br/><br/>the characters are just great. I was so excited for Tom's  and Grimalkins narration....Jenny has become a primary main character, sometimes she's awesome, sometimes just plain and usual. Grimalkin just <br/><br/>steals the show (as always). The only complain that I have about hate book is that Tom is portrayed weak as compared to Wardstone Chronicles, we do not see him stopping time, searching for Alice, kicking <br/><br/>the butt of dark demons as much as in the original series but in my opinion, this series takes the readers on a hell of a journey, i was grasped by the book and finished in within two day, loved it straight. <br/><br/>The locations mainly include the pristine and everygreen County, stripped of darkness (till now at least..), The Kobalos island, the moors and some local towns and villages. The pace of the story is <br/><br/>inconsistent, sometimes too quick, sometimes moderate but enough to keep the readers on the edge. The characters are richly depicted, character development is steady and progressive. In fact, the entire <br/><br/>book is well planned and the author knows where he's heading. The plot involves the readers as there are numerous layers of the story that merge and combine together to form a bigger and a much greater <br/><br/>picture. Some things in the book really made me smile and brought back those sweet memories from the Wardstone Chronicles. Thought, it isn't mandatory to read the prequel series, I would surely <br/><br/>recommmend you to do that before taking up these. Jenny has her own narration,  just a couple of chapter, but interesting and entertaining, it gives you an insight about a girl's life as a spook and her <br/><br/>expereicnes. In fact, the point of apprenticing a girl has been highlighted throughout the wourld as unorthodox and sometimes Tom just pays for it. There's too much of action, fight scenes and <br/><br/>battles...The central antagonist is the Kobalos mages and soldiers. In the beginning the Haizda mage and the Vartek worms are of primary importance. Jenny's training is done very well by Tom. I ust <br/><br/>enjoyed Tom's emotions and how his mind functions. Danger never seems to end for our young heroes. The book has many aspects and fractions which are impossible to combine into a review but still they <br/><br/>complement each other and make the story even better. The book is thrilling if you read it in the right atmosphere, make sure you get away form disturbances and read it peacefuly. Delaney has delivered <br/><br/>great content and I'm sad that the Starblade Chronicles is just a trilogy. The starblade, a legendary blade given to Tom by Grimalkin plays  a central role in the story. Sometimes, i have to say the book <br/><br/>beomces a bit dull, but picks up pace as soon as a new chapter begins. New characters, new enemies and new locations are some other notable features of the book which has helped in expanding the <br/><br/>Wardstone Universe. The book has many positive messages, so younger readers can read the book without any care. Let me warn you there's too much of gore and blood and nasty things involved, that may <br/><br/>not exactly give you a crepp but may disgust you a bit. i.e. decapicated limbs of cattles, spary of blood, beheading, cutting off the nerves and eyes, etc. etc. I'm just sad that the dangers seem never ending <br/><br/>and an impossible task is at hand -  defeating, spy<br/>ing and bringing down an entire Kobalos army before it invades the County. Ah! But nothing too serious, just the ""Fun"" stuff. Do read this book after dark for a special effect. Free Audiobook is not available <br/><br/>on Youtube, so you may have to buy it from Audible if you wish to make your reading expereince better. The end and conclusion is  a cliffhanger. (Not Really, Tom just can't die). I didn't even believe it <br/><br/>when Tom died, it's just not possible, but he's not mentioned in the next few chapters and that got me worrying, but let's hope he is alive. I'm finding out right now after writing this review as I'll pick up <br/><br/>The Dark Army. Anyways, this  book will leave you amazed, smiling at some references fromnthe Wardstone Chronicles and somewhat thrilled. Positively suggested to all dark fantasy readers. Keep <br/><br/>Reading, may the light overcome the darkness. The plot of the next books in the series is definitely going to be groundbreaking. I'm hping Alice makes a return. Grimalkin is nothing but the best, Jenny <br/><br/>picking up speed and adding a hint of magic to the book. Well, I'm excited to finish the series as soon as possible.",,,1,0

I'm really glad to say that I was not at all disappointed and this book delivered more than I'd expected, in terms of writing, story, character development, originality and of course, the Maitlandish climax of you don't mind my expression. Karen Maitland, an author who specializes in hisotrical fiction, which are based in reality with accurate inspirations from existing historical locations, traditions and folklore she crafts a wonderfully dark, mysterious and atmospheric tale of supernatural haunting and the nature of mankind. Now, of course, Dartmoor fit the storyline like a perfect location to kick off the journeys of multiple characters and as a reader to watch them converge and finally come together for a much satisfying and thrilling end. Each of the point of view narration was filled with utmost detail, carefully crafted origin and a distinct personality which spoke a lot about each of these characters and I personally was inclined to like Brother Nicolas and Prioreess Johanne but sadly, that didn't work in my favour in the end, did it?? Now, these characters have a very powerful and storngly built principles along which they act and take decisions which heavily influences the path the story takes. I even liked Sorrel and Morwens storyline which was not parallel but a convergent as it managed to explain the Dartmoor horrors and gave enroumous background about the Tinners and the common folk along with the witchcraft and other info about creatures of the night and godly voices. The Tinners storyline helped me as a reader to read quickly thought he book as the plot was not focuses on a single confined location of the Priory of St. Mary. <br/>The fanciful idea about the French Inquisition and the Knights of Sir John fitted the story very well and added a gleam of reality to it. Matter of fact, this story did not feel like a fictional narration at all, on the contrary the feelings, emotions and the stakes that each of the characters experienced and felt brought their characters to life and with so kuchd epth and serial to them, it almost seemed like an actual real life narration. Karen Maitland a skilled prose and poetic style of writing earns her loads of 5 star ratings for the book as it creates a dark, believable, enjoyable, grimly satisfying and atmospheric ring to it. I personally enjoyed the whole journey very much. The death, profanity and explicitness was also an integral part of Maitlands book just like her others, only here it seemed more refined and broadly introspective. This was quite a lot of fun.

Truly, it has got every desirable aspect of a supernatural and thriller book packed with equal action, suspense, thrill and whatnot! I read this novel as a hardcover paperback going back to the good old version of reading books and was amazed by the experience. The book length is about 500 pages complete with historical notes and glossary. This is one of the most memorable historical fiction book I've read so far. So the story is what makes you read on. The unique twist is that the author has created three layers of plotlines regarding three distinct characters and their individual life's, namely Vincent, Gisa and Regulus. These plotlines gradually develop and merge with each other to form a final picture that will leave you Bewitched. It's not a surprise to know that the end was very different than predicted but after all it's what Karen Maitland does best. The book is filled with a variety of characters from orphans, scribes, priests to warlocks with great stories to tell. Each chapter has a quote relating directly or indirectly to alchemy. It should be noted that alchemy, dark humour, dark fantasy, gothic middle age, philosophy, reincarnation and brilliant destinations are highlights of the book. The central character, Vincent and his journey throughout the book truly delights me. His gradually transition from an adult teen to a matured person is seen distinctly. Right from the first page, the tale grips the readers and thus, surely is a page turner. The antagonist is one of his kind, with a flashback tale to tell. The book has good pace and story develops quickly, at times it hangs a grim atmosphere or a suspenseful event in order to make the reader really reflect about the book. Additionally to this, the book has a lot of action scenes and violence, something which is seen here much more than other Maitland books. Even philosophical terms a d thoughts are discussed regarding to the true form of God and sacrifices in order to satisfy Him. Many characters are frightened and scared of the antagonist and his dark deeds. I loved characters such as young Regulus whose life changes suddenly when he is dragged from his bed, Gisa, a young girl who is enslaved by Sylvain, Father Regulus for his wrongdoings and mostly Vincent for his youthful and practical attitude. We encounter many superstitions, descriptions that relate to European tales. The Raven's Head influences the whole story and thus the title is aptly given. The story is colourful and vivid with point of view narrations so that the same character does not bore you again. Some content is explicit, very much explicit and hence I recommend the book to teens above 15. Many emotional feelings, attachments are highlighted. Some characters suffer trauma and illusions. Alchemy, items, tools, graphical violence are seen as the end approaches. Vincent's character in the beginning is very adorable as he works as a scribes and his love for Amee. I would divide the book into two parts. Vincents escape from England and Vincent's arrival in Sylvain's Manor. Conspiracies and secrets elevate the level of suspense. Many minor characters have been given some major role to play at times. Many things from the book can be learn relating to relations, betrayal, some chemistry, alchemy, philosophy, the dark times during the Medieval and Dark Ages. Some horror scenes and visuals are  clearly written which makes  possible for us to  effectively visualize the scene and gain pleasure and thrill at the same time. Regulus' narrative takes me back to young days and how the mind of a child works. That is indeed funny. Many sad things and ugly truths about Medieval priests and their wrongdoings in the name of transcendence and spirituality are exploited.  This isn't the usual Karen Maitland novel that revolves around Rural bliss but the kind where people are thrown into dangers and trials continuously but always overcome these obstacles and understand the value of life. I'll leave the plot and story for you to discover but surely if you enjoyed any of Karen Maitland novel, this, you will devour. Many situations in the book influence the major characters decisions. A perfect blend of mystery, fantasy, action. Strongly Recommended. The end will captivate you completely. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

This book serves as a great reference tool to the Ravens Head, one of the major works of Karen Maitland. This book serves as introduction to Alchemy to the uninitiated. The author recalls the basics of the Art of Alchemy, the various alchemist and personalities with one motive, to turn any base metal to gold or to forge the Philosophers stone. All the events that take place are claimed to be true by the author. We see many alchemist either fade away, become victorious or murder themselves while practising the art of Alchemy. We also learn about various ingredients and practices which are followed by Alchemists. The writer retells many events about Alchemists missions, how Alchemy evolved through Medieval Ages and how Royal monarchs were interested in it. An interesting book which serves as a  quick short read. There's also another section where we explore list of valuable items that Alchemists need to purchase and their quantity. The author has also provided us various alchemic recipes which are really gross but she claims that these have been taken from ancient alchemic books. This is too much to believe but if it's true, the world could have hit a lottery. Surprisingly, this book also made me reflect how science was misinterpreted or nearly perfected in the Medieval Ages too. It also reflects how man constantly wanted to evolve and improve and make better life and achieve the impossible. A good reference book and an alchemic guide. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

Overall, the book is flawless and full of twists and turns that will leave you surprised. So, the book is basically based on the medieval European period, when the villages and rural areas are infested by Plague, a fatal disease that is quickly spreading from all the four directions. As the book progresses, a series of enthralling characters are seen with a variation in personality, age, gender and culture and as we read on we learn about haunting and scary events that take place in the book which catapults you directly into the storyline and makes you wonder and stay awake battling sleep, trying to win by reading yet another big chapter. The page length of the book is about 457 pages. The protagonist of the book is a Camelot, an old person who's identity as a whole remains secret till the end and when you know about it, you will be shocked beyond imagination. It is impossible to guess, i bet on it. (Unless you sneak a peak from the last chapter) The book is somewhat based on religious ideologies, though it does not discuss God and his holiness, though we come across cemeteries, churches and other instruments of God. I like the book antagonist, who is a child prodigy at being malevolent, young Narigorm, the rune reader. Maitland is just so talented at creating young disturbed minds. There are a few similarities between this book and the Vanishing Witch. But, undoubtedly the most salient feature of 'A company of Liars' is it's cast of characters which are continuously evolving, leading to mysteries, lying and dying. Well, this book is surely not for young children as it contains some explicit as well as violent scenes. Additionally to this there is a lot of sexuality teased so young childrens, better read Harry Potter and Roald Dahl, until you come of age, then I would recommend you this book strongly. The words in the book make you reflect on human nature and emotions.  There are some mythical and legendary monsters seen throughout the book. The quotes and dialogues also amazed me. The book always sets up a kind of atmosphere, dark and grim. The pestilence is the central idea but much occurs around it too. The interaction between the proficiently forged characters is wonderful and is seen distinctly. After reaching the end, I felt like being at the top of the world, witnessing something beyond words. Karen Maitland's literary work should surely influence the Medieval Fiction English. I really like Narigorm, the Musicians, Jofre and Rodrigo, Zophiel and his arrogant personality, Adela and Osmond the lover duo who (probably) survive till the end and the bio-hybrid Swan boy. We also see the dark side of human nature and the problems that we suffer. But let me not dissuade you, this book is horror, mystery, action, suspense and moderately paced somewhat fantasy book with a few paranormal incidents along with a lot of travelling and relocating. The natural scenes and the atmosphere is set up wonderfully. The climate has been given importance. We come across various secondary characters, locations, feelings throughout the book. This one, I'll surely remember. I really want to share these quotes with you :-<br/> <br/>"" ""My lies had brought hope where there was none. I’d believed mine was the greatest of all the arts, the noblest of all the lies, the creation of hope. I thought hope could overcome everything, but I was wrong. Hope cannot overcome truth. They cannot coexist. Truth destroys hope. The most savage cruelties man inflicts on man are committed in the pursuit of truth. My last lie had been the most honest, the most honourable of them all, for there is an art greater even than the creation of hope. The greatest art of all is the destruction of truth."" ""<br/><br/>It has taken me months, years perhaps, to fathom the answer. Home is the place you return to when you have finally lost your soul. Home is the place where life is born, not the place of your birth, but the place where you seek rebirth. When you no longer remember which tale of your own past is true and which is an invention, when you know that you are an invention, then is the time to seek out your home. Perhaps only when you have come to understand that, can you finally reach home.<br/><br/>A dark, grim and a suspense novel that will leave you  in a devasted and inspired state of mind at the end. It feels like a Karen Maitland and at the same time not like a Karen Maitland novel. Lot of blood, gore, life inspiring quotes and things that will amaze you. I love the behaviour and the personality of each and every character. Just amazing. Undoubtedly, I'll be reading more of Karen Maitland's terrifying tales.  Nice Reading.",,,1,0

This is my third major Maitland novel which revolves round the Medieval Ages, particularly the class of beguines, a group of God's devotees who look after the welfare of the community and the local people. The book is divided into several parts based on the timeline and seasons. The chapters are comparatively short with point of view narration of key characters right from the Beguine leader,  a priest and a poor young girl which influence the plotlines distinctly.  This book has its up's and downs with a lot of action, but nothing you would expect. As always, the journey from the beginning to the end is filled with great experiences, emotional feelings and attachments to the book whose importance you realize just after finishing the novel. The characters are awesome. The Character Narration is above expectation. There are just a few times when you get bored as if nothing is really happening. The book highlights all the vices of the society and the battle of good and evil. God, Faith and Holiness is mentioned continuously . The plot is too hard to convey within 3000 words but you should definitely check this book out. The vivid description of human emotions, feelings, beauty of nature, dirty politics and the middle ages superstitions are highlighted too. I love the way the author has shaped, moulded and developed the town of Ulewic and the queer residents in it. There's a hint of supernatural demons and giant owls too, if you are in for a dare. The plot develops quickly. Some extracts are so good, it makes your inner soul crave for more. The book is definitive and bold. Not only this but it also has many aspects such as witchcraft, supernatural deities, gods, women, politics, poverty, leprosy, beguines, motherly emotions, conspiracies, betrayals, etc. Even hardcore fantasy/high fantasy fans will be amazed to read such great work of writing. What amazes me the most is that even though the book revolves around women I want to recommend it especially to men, so that we understand the way how women think and work. Many controversies, questions regarding life are teased throughout the book. Each part has some saint mentioned and some legendary belief about that saint is given as an informative article for readers. Took me a week to read, page length is around 500. Overall, a nice read, something different and unorthodox, which is hauntingly scary, chills you to the bones and exposes you to the ugly truth of the world. A fantastic read. Will be reading more of Karen Maitland surely. The author experiments a lot and I just love the way she is so professional at conveying emotions and blending them with historical facts. Strongly recommended to everybody. (16+) Nice Reading.",,,1,0

It's very short and easy to read within a single sitting. But mind you, it is as horrifying as any of the authors other books. So, the book begins with a record of children's presented by author in a fantastic narrative that scares the readers. The author explores the historical crimes committed by juveniles and how they killed or instigated elders to kill just for the sake of pleasure and fun. The author makes a point by convincing that the innocent young souls we call children are much much different (were). Many scary events have been presented with dates which seem to be real (or are real, as he author claims). If you don't believe it then dates and names of courts are given. Also included are witchcraft tales, blasphemous accusations and gory murders all committed by young children. Reading this section left me a bit scared. The next section follows brief information about Ten Medieval Poisons and how they can be used effectively. Along with the name of the poison, the author has also provided it's physical description and it's major uses across history to assassinate or murder other people. This is very informative but not really useful in modern times. Next we have Ten Medieval antidotes to Poisons, some of which are still used today. Similarly​ to the preceding sections, this sections shows how to counter various Poisons and it's effect. The ingredients used in it are rare and indigenous. A very informative book which may serve as a reference for all of Maitland's proficient works and the author also explains at the beginning of the book how she has adopter characters for her book from the crimes committed by juveniles and the popular Poisons were actually used in England at a large scale. The book also includes a sample chapter of The Plague Charmers as well as the Vanishing Witch, both of them are Authors works. I would surely recommend this book to anyone who's Binge Reading Karen Maitland. A great reference book to all her works. Nice Reading.",,,1,0
21353509,The Vanishing Witch,Karen Maitland,"Maitland, Karen",,147221501X,9781472215017,5,3.82,Headline Review,Paperback,497,2014,2014,01-12-17,21-11-17,fiction-ya-standalone-and-others,fiction-ya-standalone-and-others (#179),read,"*The Vanishing Witch* by Karen Maitland<br/><br/>  Its been a long time since I read a standalone book. I was never fascinated by standalone books but Karen Maitland’s The Vanishing Witch has left me amazed. I have planned on continuing to read more of the author’s books. (In fact, the complete bibliography). So, this is my first Maitland novel, and I already know that mostly all her novels are historical thrillers, or historical horror and that is a new genre I have begun to explore. This book is comparatively vast and surely not for beginner readers. It broadens over 600 pages and took me 10 days to read. I was addicted to this book, it has almost no flaws and there’s nothing I can complain about. There’s a lot of story hidden inside these 600 pages, all the stuff that you will be surprised to read. There is some high vocabulary used. Some content is inappropriate for younger readers so they should keep their hands of this book. If you ask me this book contains many elements, both good and bad, such as witchcraft, violence, blood, gore, adultery, poverty, business, historical villages, revolts, rivers, towns and a whole lot of varied and vivid characters, each of them unique and providing magic to the story. The chapters go slow, but the overall story moves around a year and a half. Maitland succeeds in creating a wonderfully Gothic atmosphere right from the beginning of the book, you know right from the first page that this is quality writing and narration. This book has been inspired some Norse Mythology elements and is based on England’s history and the Dark Ages. It takes place during the rule of Richard II in the town of Lincoln, River Bratheforde, London and other minor places. The characters are well placed, both rich and the poor and have to go through a lot in the book. The book is full of surprises and quality narration. In fact,t eh narrator is a Lincoln Town ghost who overlooks the people of the town. The story revolves around Robert, a wealthy businessman of wool and textile and how he faces a variety of dangers and paranormal experiences when three women enter his life. I.e. Catlin, Leonia and Diot. Also young children and their dreams are laid out in the story. The plot becomes much more complex as various relationships are intertwined and many of our beloved characters die giving us surprise and shock. The book is full with descriptions, philosophical quotes, hardships of life, some terrifying events, historical lifestyle and culture, witchcraft, usage of poison and murder and life during the hard times when poverty existed in England. I just loved the character of Adam, Robert, Leonia, Edward. Gunter’s story line seems fluctuating. The book seems very realistic as if the events actually happened and as if Maitland has lived the life of every characters, for she is so proficient in explaining everybody's feeling and traits. Even the geographical layout and setup are distant and clearly understood. A good job to researching about history and converting the data in a fiction story is indeed well done. As the climax approaches, all the events align and the end is full of surprises. Something you cannot guess. There is some poetry or medieval myths and beliefs at the beginning of each chapter which may hint towards something. The reader is bombarded with some mysteries that are answered over the time. There’s even a backstory here. This characters in the book develop slowly but at the end of the book they are completely different. You will be amazed by reading this piece of literery art. It even highlights the poor conditions of people, the hearts of women, relationships between father and son and most importantly about how the people have the real power. There are a lot of emotional scenes in the book that will change your outlook towards the world, but worry not, the plot and the story line will keep you at the edge of your set. This is a definitive page turner. There’s even a bonus content available, in it a detailed appendix about various terms is given along with a timeline of the Peasant’s Revolt. I liked the Prague, The Prologue and the Epilogue too. There’s even a realm of ghosts. This book underlines and highlights human behavior and prejudices along with the fun of some scares and violent event. Strongly recommended. Karen does a wonderful job at creating the atmosphere. It also serves as a history lesson. Mountains, Rivers, Seas, Castles, Palaces, Warehouses and the English countryside are richly described. The seasons, the time, the locations and the events that take place compliments each other. The only thing I have to complain about is that this book stole a lot of my bed time. I have discovered a new writing style that keeps the reader enchanted to the beautiful story and the compelling characters that make this novel a wonderful and a definitive read. Surely recommended to everybody over 15. Nice Reading. ",,,1,0

True to it's title the book revolves around a small town full of simpletons. Stephen Rose, a kid who can bring clay objects to life with an incredible talent engages with Davie and the latter's life shifts suddenly as he witnesses the strong forces of nature and impossible phenomenons that beak the laws of life and death. What really distinguished the book is it's simple but engaging storyline, it's quick to read nature and overall gradual shifting from lighter to darker tones. The primary characters in the story are Davie, Georgie, Stephen Rose, Father Priest, Crazy Marrie and clay creatures bright to life. Dialogues and conversations are filled with 'Nowts' and 'Aye's' and 'Live'.  The character of Cray Mary is one of it's kind, though she doesn't appear much in the story. Also, Davie is our protagonist, a teenager who tries to cope up with his teenage life but gets dragged into more trouble. Georgie is a great supporting character who always guides Davie and tries to stand by his side. The real troublemaker is Mouldy, a bully and a thug, but he's sorted out later in the book. One of my favorite characters in the book is the Art teacher (Prat or something) who, in his classes, tells about some profound philosophical thoughts which relate to the story at some point or another. He's a adorable, patient and a compassionate person who really sets a lighter tone to the story. To tell the truth, I wouldn't classify this book as YA nor will I classify it as an adult book. Anybody with a liking for some Strange Thing's like interest should immediately pick this book up. There's some profanity here and there, a little bit of graphical violence it what you need t look out for is the evil thoughts and sins committed by Stephen Rose and his dark thoughts. I wouldn't call him an antagonist as he plays the role of an anti-hero. There are a whole lot of twists in the plot now and then. The location the story was set in is depicted in a very rich manner as the author has successfully attempted to blend the story into reality as much as possible. I'm almost sure that these countryside suburban locations are inspired from real life and they do have fancy names. THe story is fast-paced, has deep psychological insight, highlights religion and belief in God, witnesses supernatural and impossible to believe phenomenons and throughly engages the readers with its fast paced first person narration style. A dark book with immense potential. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

The total lack of major plot points rally surprises me because the quality of the story has been turned down a notch and it really failed to reach the heights of it's predecessor by still is very much readable due to the writing style, dialogues and engagement with multitude of characters which thankfully keeping the Shadowhunters spark alive. Of course, it has some very good moments but I expected so much more from this book. The plot hasn't covered much even though the book has a near 400 pagelength but trust me, there's a lot of build-up and secondary plotline development which will be quite important in the future installments. Also, I'm not a big fan of the Love traingle which I can't say is conventional but it isn't too original in itself too and that sort of gets in the way of the major plotline which I adore and am excited for so much. Talking about characters, Alec seems to have faded just a bit, Isabelle too. Simon and Jace are often competitive in order to deal the deal with Clary and I kind of dig it but I don't think it should be the highlight of the book. The first Arc with Jace getting imprisoned and the Inquisitor's grudge against Valentine was okay-ish for me but have way for a lot of action and world building followed by the subsequent city of she's Arc where the silent brothers are killed and the Mortal sword is stolen and that is kind of where I felt the book should have started and spared the introdcutiory bullshit but anyways, I'm a great fan of the style of writing and won't complain anymore. Let's get to Valentine. Now, I don't know what Cassandra Clare has in mind but he seems too jumpy and keeps shifting in and out of narration and there's just way too mystery and confusions about him. By the end of the book I'm not sure what to believe anymore, I think it would have been better to give a clear and strict canonical parentage chart so there's no speculation and confusion about who's who's real parent and people can just get along with each other. The world building and the dialogues are a whole new level and I really appreciate that. It is flawless and I loved everything about it. The locations and the character's attributes seems a bit fresh and Clary seems seasoned enough to have her own adventures. The lightwood family got a headburst into the series and I'd like to see the story getting complicated moving onwards. The last few chapters got me feeling shocked and were a bit fast-paced that others and that was the turning point. Also, the book answered a few minor questions and left new burning questions for the readers and I'm hopping right I the City of Glass. I need to get through this series ASAP. Until next time.

This book is addictive though some parts of it are predictable with the author leaving major plot hints right in 5he beginning. The reading journey through the book is fast paced, gripping and has the reader anticipating all the time. I was impressed all the way with the traditional YA narration, (Clare has some rich and marvellous word power and understands that she's writing the book for teens and references frequently about what we love) impressive character traits, love triangles, the supernatural/magical/demonic hidden world and stunning locations. The plot points are evenly spread out and dialogues and key plot points occur at regular intervals which did not bore me at all. One major issue I had with the book was Jace's alliance with Valentine in the end, that was so not him and I can't even begin to comprehend that Clare used this betrayal trope so casually.(only for a limited period though)<br/>Isabella, Alec and Jace are undoubtedly my favorite characters with Clary and Simon making it to a close second and I don't know how I feel about Valentine, Hodge and the other Circle as they have almost the same villainous tropes. I.e. selfishness, world glorification through death, betrayal and slaying innocents. Though it's the first book Clary has not waster any time to plunge the readers into a mid-fantasy somewhat complex world with introducing lore, histories and the development of the Shadowhunters Academy. The series has immense potential. The story felt original and I was engrossed by the flow of writing. Seems like an almost perfectly balanced book. Trust me, there are some hilarious moments too, mostly with Isabelle and Simon and I loved each and every part of it. I can only think of all the great things to come. Of course as it is both a character and plot driven series there were a lot of gut-wrenching, shocking revelations and intimate character moments which left me wanting for more...<br/>A series which can rise to an epic level, perfectly balanced and I think every teenager will like(to say the least) this dive into the mysterious and extravagant world of Shadowhunters. On to the city of Ashes immidietaly. Also, the Silent Brothers scare me. A lot!<br/>Nice Reading.",,,1,0

This book was much more grim and cheesy. For starters, the 'romance' shifted to primary importance which was a real letdown experience for me, Lunch certainly knows better than cramming the page with lovers ecstasy, joy, jealousy and sadness. But still, she does a good job of expressing the characters emotions, especially June's, she felt so real to me. The book had much lesser action compared to the previous book which is saying a lot anyways. Most of it builds in the second half of the book and builds the reading momentun. The political manuvers surround Anden are spread throughout the book. I would say that this is more of politically infused story rather than just a Dystopian Fiction. And there's a lot less science here. What really got me into the sorry was the sudden surprises and twists almost at every corner of the chapters very much similar to is predecessor Legend. Lu opens up a whole new world of the Patriots and their fresh freaky cadt of characters which complement the story really well and breaks its monotony at certain points. I think the book would be a perfect masterpiece if the romance was dulled down a bit and the narration was improved. Everything here is straightforward and I can't take much of that. Too simple and easy to read with nothing spicing up the flow of words. On the whole, the story is truly revolutionary. I liked it's unpredictable nature, I mean this doesn't work like those other books where you know exactly what's going at you. On the contrary most of the times even if you predict 5-6 events likely if happening, the authkr delivers dinnering competition be which takes the storyline into an entire different direction and I loved his this worked with Day and June flipping the Assassination of Anden and working as Republic agents for the betterment of society. A lot of events occur on the side which are worth noting and may foreshadow the events of the final book into he trilogy. Eg. The flawed relation between Tess and Day. Eden's return from being a biological weapon against the colonies. Razer's imprisonment and the functioning of the Colonies and their governmental structure. We saw futuristic automobiles airplanes and huge banging ammunition at the climax. I enjoyed Day and Junes flourishing relation right from the beginning but was a bit frustrated at the end setting Day break it up with her due to his terminal illness. I am enthusiastic about the final book 'Champion' to see how it goes but I get the feeling that there's nothing left to tell anymore. I don't know why but this book feels as if it's a happy/sad ending or a mini-conclusion on it's own. I was almost blown up before Days X-ray came out but then things went downhill and I realized that Dystopian sequels never end happily, maybe the concluding book but never the sequels, they always go down hill. Quality wise this was a but less entertaining but Anden's character certainly added a whole new perspective to the storyline. I would love to see him share his own POV in champion. The author has made the transition from Legend to prodigy and it certainly deserves the hype. Let's just hope the ending will be a bit less surprising and happy. This book really made me feel about the characters. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

Marie Lu takes the previous frame or her characters and evolves them beyond boundaries faced by never-seen-before dilemmas, boosting the narrative pace of the storyline and delivering a bittersweet conclusion to this thrilling trilogy while honouring the dead characters through and through. I was really intrigued by the beginning with Day and June breaking apart like strangers again. Anden, Tess', Eden and Commander Jameson's role in the storyline now becomes primary. The world building is impressive and original with the Antarctica superpower introduction and their philosophy. Lu has certainly held the attention of the readers with burning questions unanswered till the concluding chapters and layers of surprising details added into it. I won't give any plot summary or spoil the book for you but let me get this straight. The story flows in such a way as the even the reader questions what's sane and rational anymore? This book really had me in two minds. The good and bad cannot be predicted and the characters choices and decision are the driving force for the storyline, especially June and Days. Both of these characters suffer a lot throughout the book and their relation seems to be hesitant but blossoming at the same time the ending felt a bit weird to me but all fell into place once the final dialogues were read. The  written prose is dry as ever with hardly any complex word or length description of the materialistic world. The writing leans more towards the emotional appeal between the primary characters. If you get emotionally attached to any of these characters you might have a severe meltdown. The 10 year timejump surprised me most. I also wanted a bit more of the Chancellors appearance and interaction than one just spanning a couple of pages. I'm still a bit hazy about the middle part of the story where things fall into transition and part of it felt a bit meaningless to me. The core ability of Lu lies in character and world development, a headstrong plot and story twists and never ending surprises but fails at the narration and flow of words. But that's a good thing as this book is readable fkr a mich younger audience who can easily access this story. This one seemed a bit darker than the previous two(which make sense at concluded the Trilogy).<br/>Also I liked the way how Eden stood for himself and volunteered to get tested for the cure. There's a lot to learn from the book. Chivalry, the greater good, helping the less privileged, sacrifices, loyalty and and rebellion against the anarchist to state a few. I'll always cherish this series. It's left an indeliable mark on me. The bittersweet and original ending blew me away. Nice Reading!",,,2,0

This fast-paced straightforward books really help me to finish and surpass my yearly reading challenge. Most of the Dystopian/Rebel books make it to the top of the readers list and this is no exception. Legend was thoroughly entertaining, subtle and full of action and non-stop twists in the storyline. If the story is anything it's surprising. Taking unexpected turns at almost every chapter drove me crazy and I literally could not put the book down. It is a remarkable accomplishment for Marie Lu to portray such realistic and heartfelt emotions in the written word. The characters, the Republic felt astonishingly real and relatable, not at all like a fictional setup. The story is easy to follow and seems like a mainstream YA plot. To tell, the truth it does feel like it's heavily borrowed from the Hunger Games with the Girl-Boy Romance given their contrasting scenarios, the test and the ruthless Republic with their  hideous motives but the narration is completely different and more fast-paced than you would think. I opine that this is what makes the readers come back for more. If you are looking for a series to invest your emotions and time as well as reading through it quickly with no sweat this is what you should be picking up. The characters of Day, June, John, Matias, Jameson and Thomas really set up the bigger stage for the action taking place. Without a doubt, 'Day's' journey as a street rebel seemed very believable and June., initially blinded by the republic's amicable and resourceful campaign against the colonies adds contrasting colours and a whole new perspective to the story giving the readers an unbiased view towards the storyline at the beginning. June's transition from the Republic patriot and hero towards Day's ally is noticeable throughout the chapter with her leaning towards the more honest and noble cause bit by bit and this was really amazing coming form the author. I think the anagram code left by mathias was a bit too much to believe but worked well with the storyline. What blew me away the most was the news that Day got the perfect 1500 score. That really heightened my interest in the series and drove me to finish the book in the next couple of hours.  On a side not, I strongly believe the romance between Day and June (such odd names for protagonists, don't you think?) will keep budding and kindling in the following books but I positively hope that it won't be covering the primary 'action and adventure' storyline. The series has immense potential. The Elector Primo's appearance midway could be teasing something much more grander and elegant in the future installments. I was hooked right from the beginning. The author portrays much fo the street life in the Dystopian society and makes the reader empathetic about them. There's too many deaths and killings in the book and Day does not seem to grieve much about his mother and John, this was a bit unbelievable even for a crook like him. Many other interesting events occur deviating form the primary storyline, the most noticeable is Thomas' interaction with June and his growing suspicions. Like I said, the book goes off the tracks at many places and it's a thrilling rollercoaster ride. What sets this book apart from other dystopian books is that the protagonists are already fueled by their existing skills and talents and don't have to go on a whole new journey to build their personality. Right from the first page, the author gives the reader crystal clear clarity about the characters and the rest that follows is their evolution and development in personality traits page by page. Their was much action and emotional manuveurs in the story, mostly knife fights and gun shootings. Overall, an action packed book that's easy to rad and follow with surprises awaiting at every corner, not entirely original but a bold and emphatic page turner that needs to be read by Dystopian lovers. Jumping to the sequel 'Prodigy' as soon as I finish typing this! Nice Reading!",,,1,0

Of course, the build-up, improvements in writing, action and dialogues which frequent the series and the sense of narration in general have all elevated to a more suitable raw YA stage where the thrilling and 'this book got me on the edge of my seat' part comes into play and the Reading experience is real smooth if you know what I mean. The author, James Dashner clearly knows where the story I headed, drops clues through each chapter, introduces new and relevant character which commit to the plot and add much more depth and fashion to it and just raise the YA standards. It is undeniable that the dialogues or the character choices which are pivotal to the story are insanely cliched in today's age but with respect to the year of release of this book, I'm perfectly fine with it. Now, the book does address some themes like Betrayal (I got some hardcore Hunger Games vibe here but it isn't exactly the way you think it it), leadership, instinct, survival and the anarchy of the powerful. This book will definitely make you think with it's eventful and incentive beginning thanks to the ever confusing and question-raising actions of the WICKED which Theresa seems to be fond of the book literally ends with her stating that WICKED is good which really intrigues me. Could it be true? Is all this suffering, planning and the complex neurological response analysis truly for the greater good and how does it all even function? Who's leading  WICKED? It's just question rising like a Tsunami and building up to heights greater than any reader can imagine but it gives scope for the final book in the trilogy to address and answer these questions ingeniously with some major twist and surprise which may earn it some really positive reviews and I appreciate this move but it does not make this book any less entertaining. The characters have got it full on. Every single one of them has got something of his/her own. Everybody has developed a conscience and lives by a principle and most of the times we see conflict due to the clashes between the ideologies of the limited but major league character set from the Maze Runner series. The book has multiple callbacks to the Maze Runner and frequently uses terms any Shucker might be acquainted with. For most part of the book, I was really entertained and worried but not too stressed out like the first book because major characters rarely suffer and insufferable fate in the second run of a trilogy but this book does put Thomas and Minho in some really tight places which does change their personalities on a much larger level. Matter of fact, the character development here, thanks to the limited cast of characters, is insanely strong and positive here. The locations of the story are ambient, chilling and extreme though a little bit more of ingenuity would be ind demand. The desert and the caves with the skanks and other elements like death ritual, the Cure and the final thunderous struggle felt like major key plot points which were highly Entertaining for me. A lot actually ones become clear about WICKED, Theresa and GROUP B and hereon I would really like to see a radical change coming along suspecting that things are sure to blow up as this book leaves off major characters in a state of shock and mental disarray. The next book better be explosive. Loved this a lot more than the first but it falls just a bit short of YA standards. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

At this point, I had a few gripes with the ending but I'm so thankful that it wasn't cliched. Of course, it's an individual opinion. Perhaps, this is the first trilogy where every single book gets a four star rating because of almost equal quality of writing and plot progression and balanced character development. Compared to the first book, this feels totally different with the mindset of characters focusing on different and more serious agendas like bringing down WICKED. To be honest, I took the bait and thought that everybody would get a happy ending right at the beginning of the book but I should have known better, WICKED is good? Nah, well not at least until the end where it just manages to step over the edge and attempt to right its wrongs. The second book also transitions very well with this one and I could see the Easter eggs and the hidden clues come together for a bigger and complex picture. The events orchestrated by WICKED are certainly on a whole other scale which also takes the thriller aspect of the book to places it never has been before. The dialogues and the conversations are pretty intimate between the gladers and I felt the end approaching. TO be honest, this book was an emotional roller coaster but still, at some parts the characters felt a bit hollow. Also, many characters make a comeback with many surprises and unexpected allies and enmities are formed. This book consistently questions and argues about the loyalties and the ulterior motives of Theresa, WICKED, Newt and others. I had to say adios to multiple favorite characters and I really hate this book for putting me to that sad place. The story is action packed, perhaps even than before and got me really impressed with its ambitious scenes and non-stop entertaining factors. With a trilogy this ambitious, there had to be some plot holes but James Dashner has finally successfully evaded the danger and delivered some classy, quality content which stays with the reader and amazes him right until the ending, which in itself is miraculosly different than what typical readers are acquainted with. The antagonists and the overlords in the series are highly intelligent with some scientific background with some emotional aspect throw here and there which makes them much more edgier and gritty. The final struggle at the maze and the battle against the 'Rat-man' on the subway really was something. This book did not head to where I thought it would and felt somewhat out of the genre for the series but I'm okay with that because the author tried his hand at inventiveness and experimented the writing styles and got some absolutely reader hooking content which is all that matters. The cast of the 'Maze Runner' characters will always be engraved in my mind and although there was no final tribute to all those wonderful souls we lost throughout the journey they will always be cherished and celebrated for their sacrifices. The locations were mostly urban. The characters traits were mostly borrowed from the second book and built further. The explanation regarding the Solar Flares the outbreak of the Flare and its control nailed and hit the target. I'm proud of myself for having completed the trilogy in less than a week. The ending was a mega shocker. And always remember, WICKED is GOOD! Nice Reading! ",,,1,0

Every YA reader understands the significance of this series and how it has shaped the facets of the dysoptian and young adult genre with an entirely trilogy being adapted as movies. (which I plan to watch as soon as I finish this series, I also plan to read the prequel novels)<br/>James Dashner has a lot on his mind regarding the Maze runner. It's not the greatest book I've read, no but it certainly has a YA nostalgic feel to it. I just can't help compare it with the Hunger Games, Divergent or the Legend Trilogy which share the same philosophy of Dystopia and the 'Creators' in this franchise are almost synonymous to the influencing dominators in the mentioned YA trilogies. With respect to the release date of this book, it certainly deserves an applause for some truly surprising and game changing plot events that had me on the edge of my seat. The portagonist, Thomas, is not all that remarkable with common cliched traits saturating into a very relatable and known characterization but the development throughout the book was good enough for me. There is a transition in his moods and emotional will, especially as we near the ending of the book and that is certainly commendable. We also have a second protagonist, Theresa who also felt a bit hollow, I mean of course, she has a lot of dialogue and drama and a lot of attention headed towards her but I'm still not convinced that I know her philosophy, her past or the way she is. Trust me, the writing is good, the author really knows how to blend the characters into the story and thrill of surprise the reader at endings of the chapter. The language of narration felt a bit too common and easy to understand although the Glade/Maze terms added some much more excitement and anticipation to the entire story. The first ten chapters were very much memorable and resonated the idea of the 'Maze' and we are that particular idea develop and eveolve right until the end painting an entirely different picture for the readers. The secondary characters in the story are moderately numerous and entertaining but not whole, again. My favorite was Minho and Chuck, their traits just sticked out and highligted the plot elements. The action and the dilaouges interaction between Minho and Chuck with the protagonists also highlighted the story, added depth to it and made the plot Elements much more clearer. The book is perfect for beginner readers too, if I was like 13 or 14 this would be an absolute favorite, even now it delivered some kicks and jaw-dropping moments but I always hunger for something original and thought provoking which this book has a limited scope to offer, at least at this stage. The action is high, building up with every chapter. The story does leave the readers with many questions which are answered though each chapter and the complexity of the Maze slowly and gradually increases. The chapters are really short and that's what I need the most, especially in a YA book. The ending blew me away, it was certainly not what I'd expected, I mean I knew lives would be lost, key characters would play the sacrificial part but the Revelations following the escape of the 'Runners' from the maze felt like they came too fast, too soon but I'm okay with that. The book has a lot of enjoyable elements especially if you read it at night in an ambient atmosphere. I'm crazed out for the sequel. This book has its flaws but the excitement, the thrill and the ingenious puzzling motive of the wicked and the alternate universe flare stricken apocalypse approaching universe has a lot to talk about. I'm impressed. Something tells me that things are going to be in a downward spiral for the characters. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

Oh, there is absolutely no doubt that the Hunger Games series is crowned to be the Dystopian SCi-FI Epic and it truly lives up to the hype. To tell the truth, reading Mockingjay was a completely different experience when compared to other books of the series. It has a delightful yet melancholic atmosphere that gets right into your heart. The story is fast paced and rushy though author gives in enough time for near perfect character development. Of course, the most important and notable aspect in any book is the story and Suzanne nails it. At the beginning of the book the reader has no idea what he’ll/she’ll be reading for the next 400 pages but once you pass a couple of chapter you know what’s staring you right into the face and you’ll be positively terrified. If you want a happy ending, please just imagine the capitol destroyed at the end of ‘Catching Fire’ but if you’re looking for some sad yet peaceful ending this is for you. The events take place directly after the explosion and detonation at District 12. The most notable detail is the war of District Rebels against the Peacekeeper and President Snow yet the surprising and never expected twist in the end changes the way you perceive characters. Many new heart touching temporary secondary characters that die off in each chapter are introduced at frequent intervals by the author. I don’t want to spoil the book for you but please read attentively and don’t watch the movies before reading this book. I particularly liked Collins intuitive and catchy approach to narrative. Her poetry is heartwarming and sensational. A very talented person who convinces what she wants through the evergreen characters powerfully and boldly. Katniss’ character will be remembered by me for her exceptional skills and embodiment of women empowerment. Gale, Peeta, Alma Coin, President Snow, Haymitch, Cressida are some other popular characters who influence the storyline. The book loses the Hunger Games feeling because two powerful political powers directly wage open war against each other and influence and dominate Katniss. The book can be divided into two halves. The rebellion and the infiltrated assassination. The most drastic change that any character has undergone is Peeta Mellark. I can’t really place him into the ‘known’ characters anymore. He is 100% changed. It’s wonderful to see a variety of characters to overthrow a political despot. The depiction of nature has suddenly fallen, the reader is thrust into the the world of machines and mechanics all of a sudden. All new type of technology is unveiled. It is very much helpful for the futuristic world as this new district 13 atmosphere is known for the first time and helps in powerful world building. The technological advancement and powerful weaponry is something to look out for. The stakes are higher than ever. Katniss is the central character and she undergoes so much trauma in the book, OH MY GOD! I can’t even begin to describe how people platy with her emotions and carve a pawn out of her. The second half of the book is full of action, movement and we actually get to see the entire Capitol structure, the HALO idea was very creative and challenging at the same time. The horrifying deaths that follow reminded me very much of Final Destination as major characters keep falling off the game. The final act was surprising and very saddening. The aftermath of Coins and Snow’s assassination was strategic and diplomatic. The most important thing I encountered in the book is the play with emotions and trauma. The characters have changed and transformed drastically, the mockingjay is an eternal symbol of this change. Reading this book does change our approach to life, the characters continue to inspire me. Some dialogues in the book are thrilling and inspiring, they ignite a spark in your body and burn you with emotions. A perfectly balanced book that provides the reader an enlightening message in the end. The goal of the book is crystal clear. I’m truly sad to finish this wonderful series, it will inspire me to be a benevolent person always. A perfectly balanced, thrilling, inspiring, enlightening, action-packed, concluding book that you surely don’t wanna miss. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

The events in the book align very much clearly and provide a detailed and a clear insight of the happenings of the districts of Panem and the politics of the Capitol. The writing style reflects that of the ‘Hunger Games’ and is entertaining. My review will be divided into two pats- Pre ‘Quarter Quell’ and Post ‘Quarter Quell’. The beginning of the book clearly outline the variety if changes and subtle defiance of the Capitol. The writer does not hesitate to state some impossible things boldly in the book which easily enables the readers to believe them. I purely liked Katniss’ confrontation with President Snow in the second chapter. I found it thrilling and the exchange of dialogues was just fascinating. The book also highlights the intelligence of the antagonist, the weakness of the protagonists and how politics and power work, in fact, the book states the principals of co-ordination and co-operation required for a nation to prosper and work. The citizens of Panem are discontent and as the uprising starts building up you can clearly see where the rebellion is moving. Apart from the main theme, the first half of the book is full of major surprises and plot twists, let’s not forget the variety of character interaction which is another major aspect in the ‘Hunger Games’ book. Katniss has changed very much, no longer is she the shy, naive, rookie girl but a bold woman who’s haunted by the deeds of her past and wants to begin a safe and healthy lifestyle. The book also highlights her relationship and affection for Gale as well as Peeta, there’s just too much competition and romance heightens a lot. Haymitch also grabs the primary character storyline and influences the story a lot. Many events in the book are memorable but I can’t put them all in the review. The events before the Quarter Quell, especially the Victory Tour is the central theme of the book as the title suggests, ‘Catching Fire’ is in relation to the rising spark of rebellion and how the uprising intensifies (‘Catches Fire’) at the end of the book. So yeah, the Victory tour, shutdowns, protests and public execution should be expected. The book introduces many new secondary characters, provides in-depth analysis and background relating to these characters which helps the readers to understand their present situation. The writing style is fast paced, yet steady. Length of the chapters is promising. Collins introduces new characters powerfully and embeds an appealing visual image in readers mind. The locations throughout the book seem real as if borrowed from the real world itself, not just the locations but the uprising itself seems true, maybe the author was inspired to write this from some notable historic rebellion. The book does another wonderful work of exploring all the districts and their citizens and builds a rapport between the victors and the people. The announcement of Katniss entering the Hunger Games Special was unexpected yet thrilling. The cast of opponents and the slim chance of survival sets up the atmosphere of the book. Also we get to see blackmail, threat and mental torture as a part of Snow’s political dominion. Action scenes, fights, battles, traps, blood and gore is seen especially in the second half of the book as soon as the Quarter Quell begins. I loved Finnick's and Haymitch’s character. The Quarter Quell was amazingly described though it’s length seemed shorter nonetheless very challenging with cannibalistic monkeys, thunderstorms, poisonous mist, electrical shocks and a rotating clock arena. The writing style is so convincing and realistic we feel as if we are the central characters in the story and can feel their every emotion. Greatly written story with a haunting ending. You’ll devour this piece of work if you love Futuristic Sci-Fi Dystopian Fantasy/Romance/Thriller. A perfect and a casual read for young adults. Nice Reading.  ",,,1,0

For an introduction, the plot may seem weird to the uninitiated but just from the first 100 pages of the book, the theme, the idea and the character sketch is engraved in the readers mind thanks to the detailed, rational, thorough and highly entertaining and natural flow of writing, conversation and character portrayal. Stephen King is a genius and his writing style resonated so much in The Shining. According to me, this book is not just a horror, thriller or even a suspense novel, it is more of a character analysis. Dan  is easily of the most developed, plot wise and otherwise, complex, detailed character I've read till date. With boundaries that seem to fade between the past and the present King takes the readers on a wild ride with Danny, the protagonists, a child of 5 years with a extrasensory perception ability and his bizarre encounters in The Overlook Hotel which also is expanded and elaborated with great, rich details with a 10 paged chapter about its past, residents, happenings and another 10 page chapter telling about the various locations in the Hotel, it's specialties and it's haunting effect on Danny. Hotel Overlook being the primary location, has a conscience of it's own given it's dark past and it simply adds the bone-chilling effect to the primary plot like a doom looming/shadowing over Danny's family residing in the Hotel. Wendy, Danny's mother and his father, Jack (who also has an applaud deserving, awe-inspiring, mind blowing character arc and the past) are the central characters in the story sometimes madly in love with each other but most of the times swearing and kicking and trying to murder the other party, thanks to the grim influence of the overlook Hotel. It really is hard to review this book without giving away too much but Stephen King has paid enormous amount of attention in plot, location and character detailing that it all feels real and natural just like any of his other novels. The dialogue flow does not seem to be written as a part of the story but more like an intrinsic natural way that people talk and think. Most of the book also hints at the characters past and how it influences their present situation. Wendy's and Jack's past and their mental disorders are heavily addressed here which have a very damaging and wrongful effect on Danny. I mean, the book is all about it! I love Jack's and Wendy's thoughts and the controversial things which go inside their head, there are chapters and chapters about this, it truly is fascinating and it helps the reader in distinguishing their personalities distinctly and with much ease and it becomes clear who's who. The horror factor in the story is certainly high, with the room 217, the twin girls and the hedge animals working as a thrill escalator and the climax being Jack's devilish conscience coming into play with the butchering and axe-wielding and Hotel Overlooking blowing up in the end. The other character like Al, Ullman, Danny's older accomplice who warns him about the shining are very much notable and have their own part to contribute to the story. This is very much and definitely a plot driven story with multiple horror elements which are resonated and taken to new and terrifying heights thanks to the characters own darker histories, addictions and mental disorders which they are unable to cope with, especially in the Hotel Overlook, which itself adds to the fear factors. The audiobook experience was second to none and I had a really good time reading the book. I've already picked up Doctor Sleep, the Shining's sequel and lets see how that goes. This book also addresses multiple issues like  child psychology, addiction, alcoholism, trauma, PTSD, egotistical mania among others, certainly not for a younger audience. This is something to pick up in winter(as the setting in the book is very much like this), find a cozy bed and finish this chunk  in under a week at most because not only is this a definitive page turner but also a scary, spooky and character driven book that the reader never wants to put down. The writing itself is as natural as it can be with some laugh-out loud commentary in the characters mind, especially in the beginning. Most of the action and mania beings after page 250. Had a great time reading this. UNPUTDOWNABLE. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

This was absolutely a very good spiritual as well a a literary successor to the Shining which we all have been haunted and chilled by to this day. If you want to know if it is as good as the Shining in terms of world building, it absolutely is, but in terms of plot development, not so much but it is indeed very entertaining nonetheless thanks to the enormous and highly detailed character development, we are not essentially looking at a  1200+ paged character development of Danny, Dan, Doc who we have seen suffer the trauma and firsthand nascent experience of the Shining and the ghastly things which come with the gift. I really like the general theme and the plot of this overarching sequel, it nails the point where which necessity arrives for establishing a sequel because I know I wasn't the only one waiting for Danny's further misadventures. Abra, is a deserving protagonist and I'm surprised Stephen King has made her into an overtly cute, benevolent and independent supernatural entity entirely opposite of Carrie. Although, she is the primary character in the story, Dan is the primary narrator and tells most of the tell and his character development and arc is on an entirely different level. Stephen King blew me away with the action scenes, the building dread and doom with his magnificent introduction of the True Know, especially in the first half where they seemed much more frightening and formidable opponents with their vulgar, inhuman and demonic gatherings and rituals concerning extraction of souls of children who shine the most bright in order to obtain an elixir vapour of sorts and live perpetually healthily. The prefatory matters were perhaps the most heartfelt and emotional because the state Dan's in could not have been written without at least a second hand experience, its so sensual and nerve-wrecking. I was hooked to the book because of the 'prefatory matters' which are perhaps the best of Stephen King's passages ever written. Also, don't pick this book up if you haven't read the Shining, we see a lot of family connections, referenced and newly discovered(a MAJOR one, trust me!), remembrances from the past, haunting memories affecting character's present nature and subordination to others. One thing I'd like to make clear here is that there is no repetitiveness in this book, of course it references events from the shining, don't expect the same phenomenon and storyline here, it's a bit watered down and more of a thriller than horror with a fresh, never seen before battle of the forces of the light and the dark and when I say dark, I mean it really is some messed up shit. Anyways, I had a great time reading this, matter of fact I devoured this book just in 3 days despite it being a hundred pages larger than its predecessor. Stephen King really has some great prose writing and narration skills with kick-ass funky dialogue when you least expect it, this was  joyride and not entirely harmful for younger audiences, mostly because none of the 'heroes' have to face anything serious or die gruesome deaths. I really liked the pacing, the crafty dialogues, the Easter eggs and the general tone of writing.

Carrie is an adult thriller novel but revolves around a teeange girl in the 1900's. This novel completely thrilled me. I really pity Carrie, anybody who has read the novel will. It is in fact, a very moving story, the characters seem very real and the plotline is oddly satisfying. Readers beware, if you pik this chunk of a book up, you'll immerse into a gory, bloody, very explicit, sensitive material that will definitely terrify you and make you think. The antiqueness about the book is that it contains paper clippings from Journals, personal diaries of secondary characters, interviews, book and newspapers that perfectly fits into the narrative and eliminates any sign of monotony from the sotry. Even, the writing style of Stephen King is legendary. Yes, I did use the word. Legendary. Epic. Engrossing. King has a tact for grabbing the readers mind and keeping him/her hooked to his terrifying tales. The vocabulary and the flow of the story appears to be natural and organic. I never have encountered a character like Carrie's Mother. She is just beyond everything else in the book. The dominating, sin-hating, maleficient, overly religious bullshit that she keeps on ranting throughout the book is overwhelming. The base of the story is strategically set right in the beginning in the shower scene which gives a tellatale idea of whats about to come. Carrie is a novel whihc will reshape the way you percieve the Dark Ages in Medieval times. It will actually talk to you. The bookhighlights a number of important things. And by the way, there's a whole lot of action, destruction and carnage at the end. And blood, litres and litres just flowing down those pages. A truly dark novel that touched me. A rational scientific base is also added to the telekeneksis power inhibited by Carrie. The end was chilling. The prom night scene was unexpected. Carie's evolution from a bullied and harassed teenager into a powerful menacing morbid creature is worth noting. A memorable read. I'll be desperate for more Stephen King. Up next is Salem's Lot.

Like Jaw dropping, awe-inspiring, mind blowing amazed at what I just finished reading. Blood Ninja is one of the book series which will remain at the the top of my favorite shelves till the end of time. It has been a emotional journey where you not only invest your time but also your feelings and hearts content into the storyline and I'm grimly disappointed by the fact that this book series hasn't got a lot of attention lately. Anyways, here begins the review.<br/>The Title 'Revenge of the Living' symbolizes two things- the first one is Kira's state of living dead and the second, a foreshadowed betrayal of a key character which strikes me as the most surprising. I won't reveal it to avoid giving out spoilers but if you've been following up with the story you may know what to expect. This book does not shy to reach new heights and experiment with yet another set of factors which include mythos, dragons, legendary treasures, buried epic swords, realms of hell and heaven, death and morbidity and also the emotional upheaval through which almost all characters in the story undergo. The book bid farewell to a lot of my favorite heroes and villains who played their part very well to the story. The storytelling becomes way more mature and straightforward than the previous books which makes it a bit less of a fun as there's almost no humor in here. Nothing, Nada, null. But still, the epic fantasy of dragon bounties and undead pirates sailing the seas will keep you hooked. Taro is established as an adult and that again changes the way he thinks, acts and fights which has added yet another set of key elements to the story. After suffering all the losses and hoping to achieve peace, Taro confronts his inner demons and evolves as a person. The matter of marriage, Hana's love, Shusaku, Kira and Amaterasu's backstory made the story complete in a full circle resolving all the curiosity of us nosy readers. I wish I'd not let my excitement get way ahead of me and I could have read the story a bit slower as there's a lot of lie lessons, philosophical quotes and inspiring words found throughout the chapters. The story switches pace a lot and gives a wonderful overview of each and every characters personality adding layers to the previously established traits from the previous books and surprises you in fantastic and least expected ways. The part of dragon, Taro's departure from Ikko-Ikki and retrieval of the sword from the wreck went quite slow but the story picked up speed impressively after Kenji Kira's return and Shusaku's death. Yeah! He died, deal with it. Hiro, Jun and Hana are almost thrown in the background but still they have a say and impact on the readers mind as much as they did in the previous books but this time the situation is more grim and everybody's life in on the line. As the climax approached the story twisted and turned the situations upside down. The realms of hell and heaven were explored in this book which gave us a fundamental idea about the mechanics of other realms and how to transcend or descend into each of  them. The dragon fight part was unbelievable. What got me hooked to the book was the revelations of minor characters which brought the story where it currently stands and how even the smallest of decisions can help save or kill other people. The book has some hidden references and throwback tags too so memories will begin to emerge out of your hippocampus. The historical facts are very accurate and that gives the story an added depth and an edge when compared to others. The legends, the myths and the Japanese tradition are again very much highlighted in the book. These amazing characters have left an indelible mark on my mind whose existence will undoubtedly be till the end of time. The climax gave me goosebumps, the way the narration works in the end with Nick Lake's book is astonishing and jaw dropping. It gets you hooked and read the final 100 pages within a very short period of time and this happens exclusively with Nick Lake's book. I could never have believed the book would end the way it ended. I'm definitely not complaining about the standard of the conclusion but on the contrary I'm saying that it was ingenious, something almost nobody would have though of, a way if turning the story and planning and making sure it was loaded of surprises. Nick Lake has reached the culmination at which all writers aspire to reach and has bridged the gap between plot-holes and amazing storyline with his perfect storytelling, engaging characters and  emotional attachment. This has been a hell of a journey. Definitely give this a shot, more so, give this your whole focus and you won't regret it, ever. The ending was epic, couldn't have been better. That's all. Classy historical ninja/samurai/Japanese fantasy fiction trilogy done right. Absolutely Right. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

I mean simply read the prologue and you'll see why. As I approached the end of the book the entire setting, the story which occurred until now seems like a melodramatic journey and there's this new element added to it which makes the story appear somewhat smug. It's a weird expression but I can't put it in ant other words. The book is gigantic but doesn't feel so when you begin reading. The thirst for the climax leads to a smooth, fun filled, entertaining reading experience thanks to which I finished the book in less than a week. The story picks up right where it left off and wastes no time to explain the newcomers about the predecessor events. The story decidedly follows the dark note due to the tragic events in the previous novel in the series. I absolutely love Shusaku's comeback though he seems a very different person now that we get to see the world through his eyes and opinion. There are a variety of new elements and aspects added to the story not to mention the interesting new characters which effortlessly add spice to the plot and makes it thicker than most other young adult novels. The opening sequence quickly got me hooked to the book, Taro's exploration and ventures into the unventured is certainly remarkable. The author is well versed in Japanese folklore, legends and blends them with the storyline making use of the all the available resources. The most important element in the book apart from the climax of course was the addition of supernatural entities, the souls of the dead, the ghosts, the betrayal of the living. This addition completely changed the story for me. The enemies are again formidable now that Oda is back from the dead and that too with vampire abilities. If that's not terrifying I don't know what is. What intrigued me the most was the part related with Hana's death, salvation of Taro's mother and revival of Kenji Kira. Mind you, on a serious note there's a lot of death, after death and grim feelings about death involved in the book. Like seriously, you can't read a page without the implied idea or the mention of death. The atmosphere is really dark and grim, something you least expect in YA Novels and that's exactly what I love. The narration keeps shifting between mentors, protagonists, sidekicks, secondary characters and the antagonists so there is much to see here and trust me, all of it is thoroughly entertaining no matter what the chapter or the event. We see Taro coming back to Shirahama somewhere at the middle of the book and that refreshed some good old memories of Taro's secluded and easy life. This book delivers the most surprising things when you least expect them, it's got a lot of plot twists, revelations and epic moments that will give you shivers if you just read the book in the right atmosphere. The hoax with the Buddha Ball blew my mind, I couldn't recall the last time I'd read about such an intricate hoax which works all the way through the ending of the story. You can see each character shaping up, molding and rapidly changing their principles and personality with each turn of the page. Taro has really grown, he barely thinks twice before killing off his enemies and his lust for bloodshed is obnoxious making him an anti-hero  or something like that. Shuskau is not in his element yet still his contribution to the storyline is second to none. I think the most important revelation takes place after the climax when Tokugawa states that everything he has been planning has fallen into the respective places and that the endgame will soon begin. That does give me the shivers. Lord Oda's role as a villain to the story was perfect. It simply couldn't be improved, it's the best, that's it. The battle scenes in this book are much more elaborate, realistic and meticulously described as compared to the previous book. You can actually feel the tension and the excitement climbing its way upto you when you dive into the last hundred pages. Nick Lake gets the characters exactly where he wants in the final moments to give you a mind blowing surprise and leaves you fascinated. Seeing Taro's mother parting and Hana coming back to life was a very emotional moment for me. The Ikko-Ikki clan, the monks, Tokugawa and Oda's surface alliance, Shukaku's blind fights, Taro's emotional torment and breakdown and his rise into the glorious path of victory is definitely worth the time it takes to read the book. I found many of the quote relatable. The book is easy to comprehend, has a fancy cover and an impressive storyline in and out. I think the book has got  it's issues. Many fan favorite characters returning back to life, even the villains which was the case with the last book, there seems an excessive repetition with addition of some fresh and new aspects which may broaden the storyline later. But compared to the first book, this is much more intricate and action packed. I'm really excited to see how the story goes. The last fifty pages will give you the chills. Mark my words. Let's see how strong a blow the last book in the series delivers. I'm diving into it without  any further delay. Strongly recommended to people above 14 years of age. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

I’m really glad I read this book and of course I’m going to continue the series. Such books deserve a lot of attention and praise. I couldn’t find any plot summary at tall on the internet so I thought about posting one. (Scroll down)<br/>I’ll give it to you that its an enormous book, took me a week to complete but it makes up for its gigantic size with it’s fast paced storyline with surprises and action at every page that will leavve you fascinating and craving for more so it’s a nonstop journey where you can’t keep the book down at all. I mean, just read the prologue, if that isn’t what will drag you in, I don’t know what will. The writing style is very common to other writers, simple, straightforward with a hint of foreshadowing and melodramatic effects which is simple to pick up and enjoy. I absolutely love the deluxe edition cover. What’s intriguing is that the writer provides us with a perspective of almost all characters throughout the book, it’s mostly Taro but even minor characters are given a chapter narration sequence adding much more depth to the overall story and imagery. Of course, as it is a Japanese/ Eastern Culture based story be ready for some Buddha philosophy, Sutra’s, Japanese weapons, Samurai and of course, bloodthirsty ninjas. The writing style totally redefines the expectations of the reader from the story and transports us into the political deceptions of the rulers in Japan and how a common peasant boy with a secret heritage losing everything in just a few moments is converted into a ninja and thrust into the secret wars of the daimyo’s. I cannot stress enough about the storyline and how amazing it is. Just a heads up, the story gets really boring in the central part with the introduction of the ninja clan and the rivalry between Kawabata and Shusaku. The character development is superfast and super entertaining, trust me on this! Each page adds minor details to the characters image and finally on the last page a wonderful masterpiece is observed even if the character is dead. Another heads up, people die in this book, even ninjas and samurai lords, a lot and in horrifying ways. It is undeniable that there not be blood and gore in a ninja novel. Shusaku was a wonderful person, mysterious in the beginning and a wide open book in the end with transition that revealed interesting details about him. Heiko and Yukiko also underwent strong character developments, so much so that Yukiko transformed into a formidable villain by the end of the book. Hana, no doubt was described in metaphorical and beautiful ways and found a place in my heart. Taro may seem a bit off as he’s the main character but I have mixed feelings about him. His personality is yet to develop and evolve in the upcoming book but for starters Nick Lake has indeed done a applaud deserving job with the series’ main character. Kira and Oda are the primary antagonist of the series and I can’t even begin to describe them. I was shocked by Kira’s back story. As I said, the author works either on the past or the future and adds tints of color to his characters for constant development. The locations in the book are in fact based on real places such as Minata, Shirahama, Nagoya and the dead volcano crater which adds a bit of a historical twist and blends in reality with the fiction. Each of these locations have a characteristic trait which changes the atmosphere of storytelling. Good work on that Mr Lake. These locations even play an important part in combat, action sequences and the legends that took place here. The readers get to know a bit about Japanese folk lore from characters like Shusaku, Heiko and Taro and the fate of the characters is directly related to these legends. I adored the idea of the vampire ninja/ kyuuketsuki and their traits. It redefines the word ninja and adds a lot more to it! It’s been a wonderful and a long journey but in no ways exhausting. You can actually see how the story grows in the chapter summary drafted by me below. The climax was full of entertaining content with action and yet more surprising revelations. I parted ways with some of my favorite characters like Shusaku and the Abbess and I hope they’ll find their way back to life in the following installments. I really don’t want the villains to die either, their contribution to the story is rather enchanting. Right from the beginning of the book you can see the author laying out pieces of the puzzle and as you progress through the book you’ll see each part fitting together and by the end you’ll be left stunned and wondering how much of it is true and I bet you, I can’t even wait to read the second book in the Blood Ninja series. It’s been a roller coaster ride. Nice Reading! <br/>========Highlights from The Book========<br/>*Then the girl stood over him and drew a brutal wakizashi from her kimono, the short-sword’s blade so sharp it shimmered as if surrounded by heat. She whirled it around her fingers expertly. And then the ninja knew that it was over. “Tell Lord Tokugawa that if he continues to send me assassins, I will continue to send him corpses,” she said. “Let him set the world against me, and I will kill the world. Tell him that. And tell him if he wants me to spare his life, he had better send Taro next time, not some weakling of an ordinary ninja. That boy owes me a death.” The ninja looked up at her, faint hope in his one working eye. “You’re allowing me to live?” The girl paused. “Ah. My mistake.” The ninja tried to smile. Then she struck, hard and true, at his heart. “I’ll just have to tell Tokugawa myself.” Yes, this was not a good place to be out at night, all alone. Especially if you were a ninja.<br/><br/>*From an early age he had taught himself to make firing the bow a kind of meditation, believing in his mind that the arrow was already sunk deep in its target, that the only thing required was to loose the string and let it fly.<br/><br/>*He dreamed that one day he might actually be a samurai; that he might leave this little village to enter the service of the great Lord Oda, fall in love with a beautiful samurai woman, and finally die gloriously with a sword in his hand, refusing all mercy, and tendering no surrender.<br/><br/>*Lord Oda. He was the strongest daimyo the Kanto had ever known, and strong samurai always made bitter enemies. His heroism, his extraordinary ability with the blade, and his genius for the tactics of battle had made him a god to his people, and a demon to those he had defeated. It was said that when he was first named a kensei—a “sword saint”—in recognition of his mastery of the katana, he barely went a day without being challenged by some samurai desperate to make his name ring out over the land. All of them had died.<br/><br/>*Real adventure involved pain, loss, and blood. Sometimes all at once.<br/><br/>*She seemed now as strong as ever. Her face was lined by the years and the harsh water of the sea, but there was still prettiness in the sparkling eyes and the pleasingly oval line of her jaw. She smiled and was illuminated almost by a kind of inner light that only the kindest and wisest of people possess.<br/><br/>*Land that is rained on will harden. Suffering makes us strong.<br/><br/>*He saw his own hands as they flew between bow and quiver, knocking ninja after ninja to the ground, every shot perfect, whether he aimed at eye or chest or hand raised to throw. He saw the ninja beside him, his blood master now, draw a long and perfect samurai sword from a concealed scabbard that ran down his spine, under the black cloak. Taro saw the wavelike pattern of sand-cooled steel down the sword’s blade and knew that it was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>*Hana breathed in the scent of the pine forest. She was not far from the castle where her father, Lord Oda no Nobunaga, ruled his fiefdom, but she was alone in this clearing, and for once could simply enjoy the feel of the horse beneath her, and the clear country air around her. Her father had no sons, but sometimes he joked that Hana had inherited his male spirit, even if she could never inherit his title of daimyo and rule over the Kanto when he died.<br/><br/>*The drama of death, the grace of the hawk, the elegance of the twisting branch.<br/><br/>*He missed them the same, and in that moment he didn’t know which was worse—to never again see the one who was dead and beyond the torments of this world, or to never again see the one who lived and who languished somewhere in fear and hiding.<br/><br/>*Form is emptiness and emptiness is form. Form is not different from emptiness, and emptiness is not different from form. It is the Heart Sutra.<br/><br/>*I will be rained on, he thought. It is in the nature of revenge to suffer. But I will grow strong, and I will use my strength to find my mother and avenge my father.<br/><br/>*A person cannot be killed simply for failing in the face of impossible odds.” Shusaku came back for the third man, the ambassador himself. “Usually,” he said softly, “that is just what gets people killed.”<br/><br/>*He remebered lying covered by the bodies of the dead. Six days he had lain there, sucking dew from the ground, and moisture from the cold swords of the dead. He had tried to move, but his leg had been split open from hip to knee, and even if he had possessed the strength to cast aside the horse that lay over his lower half, he would not have been able to stand. So he had remained trapped there, and it was after two days that the bodies around him had started to fill with living things, and crawl with them. Rats had emerged from the stomach of the horse, chittering. Worms had crawled from men’s eyes and nostrils, quivering in the air as if nosing the scent of death. Even frogs had made an appearance, and of course the flies, the endless flies. By the time he was finally rescued, Kira had known that he could no longer be the same man, that he could no longer endure the insult of the organic. The men who had pressed against him in the mud of the battlefield had been fat and bloated with the gases of decomposition, roiling with the life of the low creatures that had infested their corpses. That would never happen to Kira. From the day when he had been rescued, he had never again allowed flesh to pass his lips, or anything in fact but water, rice, and vegetables. He could not tolerate that the meat of another creature should be inside him, within the confines of his flesh, as those worms and flies had insinuated themselves into the dead. The water of the stream, the roots of the earth, the rice of the field. These were the only things he would eat, and when he died, he would be burned as the samurai tradition demanded. Yes, he would leave nothing behind but gray ashes, clean and dry, just as the swords of Yoshimoto’s men had remained unspoiled—uninvaded—in that cold mud.<br/><br/>*The fourth tower! That was where her father usually kept prisoners, men who had plotted against him or otherwise gravely offended him. It was the tallest part of the castle, and was protected by a circular staircase in the Portuguese style. In theory a single man could defend it. The staircase turned to the right as it ascended, meaning that a man stationed above could wield his sword in his stronger right hand, while an attacker would have to move his to his left. It had not escaped Hana’s notice that her father had made the tower impregnable to all but himself—for who but a left-handed sword saint could hope to fight their way up? This was Lord Oda’s way; he liked always to have insurance policies. The fourth tower would protect him and his family from attackers. But if for any reason he was outside and needed to get in, the tower was perfectly configured for his disability.<br/><br/>*Yukiko bowed. “I expect to suffer. It is in the nature of revenge.”<br/>",,,1,0

Amazon Classics.<br/><br/>Pages - 216<br/><br/>*REVIEW*<br/><br/>{Characters}- There's just too many characters in the book! Many of them minor and catch readers attention for just a short span. Obviously the main protagonist in the book is a horse! Black Beauty first Point of View narration is indeed enchanting. I was hooked to the book right from the first chapter and finished it easily in a couple of days. The other characters aminky include other fellow horses, primarily Captain, Ginger, Merryfoot, etc. But the major story revolves around black Beauty ( also given other names by other owners). The owners of black Beauty include Masters and mistresses from England, thier stable assistants and young children. These characters are rich and poor, benevolent and malevolent! Beauty's narration and emotional is expressed very well. I really liked some characters who have humanity and kindness towards the Creatures of God. We see almost all varieties of humans in the book and it's an excellent insight to the life of animals. Beauty narrates her experiences, her feelings and her expectations, pains and pleasures, it really enlightened me how animals expect to be treated by humans and how easy it is to become their friends and dominate them! A very educational and entertaining book and characters that will surely amazed you. Mostly, the characters include fellow horses and Black Beauty's owners which keep changing with a few chapters and frequent intervals. Many emotions a d feelings are highlighted by multiple characters.<br/><br/>{Scenes}- The classical and rich description of England's villages is very satisfying. It pleasures the reader and I felt a soothing sensation. The scenes are mostly merry, revolving around Black Beauty's life and her experiences. A neat and clean description of her major life events takes place through chapters. Major scenes take place at a barn, stables, villages and towns, horse fairs and riding clubs. Well, what did you expect? These scenes may look pretty simple but each and every Arc has an underlying message which will enlighten the reader, if looked upon carefully. I hated the chapters which demonstrated the vices of humans, the Ill treatement of mute creatures. Many chapters informed me about terminologies and beginners guide to horse riding. We actually percieve the world from the horse's sight which is very imagintive and different from our viewpoint. The author is very creative and has delivered a very well prose and narration regarding a unique genre. Recommended to all. Locations in the book are described simply, but richly. Manors, farms, green and lush hills, the usual England outskirts.<br/><br/>{Speciality}- Autobiography of a horse. Very creative and imaginative. Explores a unique genre. Has a wide cast of characters. Readers may find it very educational, many horse terminologies and themes have been described. Feelings and emotions of the horse's are highlighted, at least the author is trying to convey the humans to get rid of their vices for the sake of everybody's good. Suitable for all ages.<br/><br/>{Rating} - 5/5",,,1,0
15747474,Spook's: Slither's Tale (The Last Apprentice / Wardstone Chronicles #11),Joseph Delaney,"Delaney, Joseph",,0370332172,9780370332178,3,3.93,Bodley Head Childrens,Hardcover,256,2012,2012,10-04-17,11-04-17,fiction-ya-standalone-and-others,fiction-ya-standalone-and-others (#124),read,"Wardstone Chronicles Book 11<br/>*Spook's: Slither's Tale*<br/>  Here, Delaney makes another attempt to narrate the story through the eyes of another character and I would say that he's a lot more successful to entertain me than his previous attempt to do so. Here, the tale is told by the Kobolos Mage, namely Slither, who belongs to the race of Kobolos, a city at the far North, away from the county. The narrators keep fluctuating i.e Sliter and Nessa, a young girl of 17(Human? Yes!)  Making another record, Jospeh Delaney ventures into another unexplored areas, but this time far far away from the County. The atmosphere, the people and the traditions are completely different but still appeasing. The story goes quite slow in the beginning and doesn't attract you, mainly because the new characters seems very distant because the story doesn't really fit into the Wardstone Chronicles, but rather as a prequel to the Starblade Chronicles (Which is the direct successor of Wardstone Chronicles. A lot of new things, creatures, magical powers and cowardly humans make appearances in the book. The major characters are Nessa, Slither, Byrony, Susan, City of Valkarky (I thought it was Valkyrie) and also the recurring and the most favorite character from the series, Grimalkin! Yes, she does make an appearance at 75% of the book. As I said, the beginning of the book is not very attractive, but as it progresses we get to understand the traits of the characters, and get to know more about them, the new beasts and the indulging plot adds a magical effect. Even the curiosity to know about the new traditions and culture attracts you later and event he pace of the story increases. The first 20% of the book is extremely dull but it catches up on later. There's comparatively less bloodshed than previous books, but still it is notable especially, the torcher and the maiming. Even a new dialect, on the Kobolos Slang words are used frequently, from time to time, by the residents of Valkarky. The real fun begins with Grimalkin's entry and then the book is full of surprises, things you can't imagine. Grimalkin may be dark and hostile towards others, but she is always fun (Except, in 'I Am Grimalkin') Nessa, Byrony and Susan are given a lot of importance in the book and provide the readers a lot of emotional melodrama like never before. Nessa is the most prominent among three. She starts to become more responsible, mature and strong as she stays with Slither, a lot of reference is made to 'blood', it may seem for a moment that you are reading a vampire novel but you are not. I especially love the actions scenes, the fight with the Hyb warrior (Great Illutstration), the undefeated Kobolos, the Three headed creature, interaction between Grimalkin  and Slither, the Nunc War, ad the descriptive city of Valkarky. The end changed completely, thanks to Grimalkin. We see at least one novel from the Wardstone chronicles with a happy ending (at the cost of Susan's life) ! I would not recommend this book to those who want to quickly finish the Wardstone Series, but if you are gonna start with the Starblade Series, you just cannot miss this book. It is like a prequel to it, but set into the story of Wardstone Series. A very well planned, descriptive, innovative, adventurous, enjoyable book. But the beginning could be a lot better!

17307313,"Spook's: Alice (The Last Apprentice / Wardstone Chronicles, #12)",Joseph Delaney,"Delaney, Joseph",,0370329805,9780370329802,3,4.13,Bodley Head,Paperback,294,2013,2013,12-04-17,12-04-17,fiction-ya-standalone-and-others,fiction-ya-standalone-and-others (#125),read,"Wardstone Chronicles Book 12<br/>*Spook's: I Am Alice*<br/>Another attempt to make a secondary narrator! But this one's at least bearable. I really don't like the secondary narration as compared to Tom's narration, the main disappointment is not getting to interpret things from our young hero's eyes, who describes it so well... while other narrators, like Grimalkin, Slither and here, Alice don't exactly contribute to the main storyline, and due to which the link between the chronology of the series gets thrashed away. Anyways, this was a good book indeed, not the best from the series obviously, but still worth reading for those who are into Alice.  It is the second-last in the series, what Delaney calls as the 'penultimate' version, The story is narrated by Alice, who, at the moment is just at the edge of the dark. The plot begins where it left off in the Spook's blood, but not much happens on Earth. Alice goes deep down into the domains of the old gods and encounters never-seen-before beasts, monsters, demons and her old enemies seeking revenge on her for her past deeds. The main aim of the book is to narrate Alice's story and a lot of Flashbacks regarding her former life with Bony Lizze, before she met the Spook's apprentice, Thomas Ward. I don't know if it's just me but Alice seems different and distant. She is completely changed now, even her words feel different. Once, she was the most adorable and interesting character in the Series but now she's brought down low. But mind you, she is as powerful as Grimalkin, especially her dark magic. There are 'recurring' appearances of 'Dead Witches' like Bony Lizzie and Thorne, the apprentice of Grimalkin in the dark domains. The book starts very well, but as you read on the story is somewhat monotonous, but later again made interesting by introducing the earlier life experiences of Alice and how she was trained as a witch by Bony Lizzie and her frightening past. The dark domains are portrayed very well, the details if the buildings, the horrifying creatures and their traits, the emotional trauma and everything. I think the book joins the dots and gives a very hard recap of the 'Ritual to Bind the Fiend', a very strong and repeated recap. It joins the dots about how Alice was earlier in her life and how t now influences her current stage. There are a lot of skelts, flying lamias, water witches, spiders, demons, beasts, namely Bony Lizzie, Krutch, Tusk, Mother Malkin, Belzebub (Another fearsome servant of the Fiend AKA Lord of the Flies), the benevolent/malevolent god Pan, etc, etc and really give you delight to read. Though, they excite you they don't exactly give you a roller coaster ride like Tom's narrative does. The mountains, building, domains seem very realistic and rational, not from a fairy tale, but as if they are real. There are multiple combat scenarios, I especially like the Belzebub, The Krutch. But Bony Lizzie just bores me. As the book approaches the end, the plot thickens but obtaining the third Hero Blade seems simple enough. It was the beginning and the interlouge part which was difficult for Alice. She, as she always does, suffers a lot of pain, maiming and tumbling emotion but wards everything away with her dark power. I seem to like her less than I used in the beginning of the series. There are two prominent flashbacks in the book covering around 45% pages, that are the Betsy Gammon affair and the other called the Testing which is relatively smaller as compared to the former. The flashbacks seem interesting in the beginning but as they go on they seem to big,  mean they are just flashbacks, Alice shouldn't go on more much longer. The deal with the water witches, the Betsy Gammon (I don't like her at all!) trade, Lizzie's demonstration of power, Arkwright's appearance are a part of the flashbacks along with eh creepy crawlers and the testing of the Three Witches. The book was well planned, with a realistic and a balanced touch, but the plot was it's downfall. If I would have been Delaney then, instead of writing Slither's Tale (A prequel to the Starblade Chronicles, set during the Wardstone Chronicles) I would have made a nice addition in the Wardstone Chronicles, with no flash backs and where Tom and Alice venture in the dark Domains together along with the Spook and the Fiend and slay the supporters of the Fiend and return back to the Earth, after gaining the Third Hero Sword. But Delaney has another plan, so I'll leave it here. A good book, worth to read but Surely not the best, I had hoped a bit better. It will be good to get back to Tom's narrative in the next, final and the chilling conclusion to the Wardstone Chronicles. Anyways, Nice Reading!!&#x1f604;&#x1f60e;&#x1f607;",,,1,0
9336232,"The Spook's Destiny (The Last Apprentice / Wardstone Chronicles, #8)",Joseph Delaney,"Delaney, Joseph",,037033180X,9780370331805,5,4.25,Bodley Head,Hardcover,234,2011,2011,04-04-17,05-04-17,fiction-ya-standalone-and-others,fiction-ya-standalone-and-others (#123),read,"Wardstone Chronicles Book 8<br/>*The Spook's Destiny*<br/>   This book just broke my record! I have to say this, I just finished this book in less than 8 hours. It was so very addicting, fueled by the ambition to reach the conclusion of the Wardstone Chronicles. I feel it coming, the end. There are strong signs that this unbelievable series is coming to an end after a couple of book. I just like the chapter titles and the illustrations. They are absolutely stunning As soon as I finished the Spook's Nightmare, I immediately started with this which got me more than surprised. First of all I would like to inform you that this novel takes you to new locations with new enemies, new skills, new people and a completely new storyline that you wouldn't have imagined for Tom and his Master, the Spook. I would like to dissect the plot into four arcs:-<br/>1) Arrival at Ireland covers 20%<br/>2) The making and breaking of the Killorglin Ritual covers 40%<br/>3) Binding the Fiend+ Encounter with Morrigan covers 30 %<br/>4) Alice's Return covers 10%<br/>I will not go deep in plot but just tell you that the antagonists are Morrigan and the Celtic witch, the goat mages who worship Pan and the Fiend itself, Tom and the Spook make alliances with local forces and the witch assassin Grimalkin and defeat all those who stand in the way of light. A lot of things happen in the book, one thing at one time obviously, that's Delaney's speciality. This time it's Tom having the worst nightmares as Morrigan, the Goddess of death haunts him in his dream and keeps chasing him in her deathly crow form. It is related to a back story when Tom and Arkwright hunted a Celtic witch and she cursed Tom that Morrigan would hunt him down if he ever came to Ireland and just that's happening so things are turning bad for Tom. I love Tom's Point of View writing throughout the book. Coming to Ireland, it has got a lot of history and the people there seem almost real, with legendary heroes and burial grounds and the 'Otherworld' which plays a major role in the book. Though however great sometime is , they cannot escape the clutches of the Dark, so Ireland is haunted by Dark Mages and Jibber, a new creature but a relatable one for the Spook. I like the introduction and how things go easily and suddenly change after the arrival of a local alliance of the landowners. The siege of the castle and the ritual covers most of the plot, but much of the light is given to Morrigan and Binding of the Fiend. They are the major focus of the book but are brought into the light much later. The new and formidable characters like the leader of the Goat Mages, their abilities, and  especially their dark ritual to summon the Nature God Pan for their evil purposes is just great. The ritual seems almost realistic and full of gore and violence with a lot of blood. The appearance of the mages are prominent. But the best thing about the book is it's story. It just twists and turns and gives you fright, excitement and thrill and you feel as if its real and happening in front of you, It has a personified touch which makes it addicting. The blood jar is also given a place of prominence as it finally is broken by the Spook to bind the Fiend in the end. (Big Spoiler)! Tom's skill seems to be not very special in the beginning of the book but as soon  as he gets the 'Destiny Blade' from Callan, a legendary Irish hero as he ventures in he 'otherworld' and cuts of the head of the Morrigan. I think the Celtic witch and the character of Thin Shaun were really unnecessary and just were an unnecessary addition in the plot but I have realized that it is due to them that suddenly Alice gets imprisoned by the Fiend. Getting to the third arc, the recurring appearance of Grimalkin just thralls me. She's deadly, she's dark, she's a rebel and she's so skilled and talented with the blade its just great to have her back in the series. She is a valuable ally to the Apprentice-master duo and is may be the only reason which the Fiend gets bind at the end. Another prominent thing after getting the 'Destiny Blade' is that Tom is not able to halt time completely,  much thanks to Mam and Grimalkin for training him and that really amazes me and adds another spice to the plot. The story, the characters, the emotions are depicted to naturally that they almost feel real which makes you want to read more and more. I wouldn't give you much idea about Pan and the otherworld but I would say that you read these selective passages slowly, taking in all the magical words that you can and give yourself a nice treat. We see a lot of new weapons, like the chain of silver spears and nails, the location of the dragons lair and immense pits all for binding the Fiend. Tom really seems experienced and almost a Spook by the end of the book, his time is coming. Its really great to see him grow so much from the start of the series. I would say that the Spook and Alice don't play a major role in the book. But Alice steals the spotlight the end of the book as she escapes the 'Dark Domain' of the Fiend after she goes through unimaginable torcher and horrors. She is a completely different personality with a growth spurt in her malevolence. She is physiologically and psychologically shaken and ever her hair turn white, she eats chickens raw and uses terrifying spells. Alice has surely changed and really broken my heart. I had hopes from her but stories twist and turn and sometimes break your heart.. I really feel sorry for Alice,  even though she is just  a storybook character she feels so realistic and natural. At the end of the book, things look good and Tom gains a lot of new knowledge about previously unknown servants of the dark. The end is approaching. A very realistic, unimaginable, addicting, magical, and a heart wrenching book that will surely amaze young readers. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

Wardstone Chronicles gets better and better with each book, the characters get better and the story more readable and attractive. Delaney, in this book has shifted his focus from trivial boggart and ghosts to malevolent and deadly witches, that <br/>are ready for bloodshed. I ready this book for the fourth time now, but I'm still entertained. Several new characters are introduced both good and bad. Father Stocks is a priest and the spooks friend, he is simplistic, somewhat mysterious, a warm and respectable person in Pendle. Delaney has completely changed his style of writing and even the environment. The story no longer takes place in Chipenden, but in Pendle, a dark village infested with witches and there's too much of them for Tom and the Spook to sort out. So they even make alliances with the local people. Pendle has been described very well, even a pictorial map has been provided to readers with illustrations a d landmarks, each with a unique darkness. I like the idea of the three witch clans, the Malkins, the Deanes and the Mouldheels. Each clan has a unique personality and is hostile/friendly with other clans. There is an intricate relation between the characters. The magic of the book starts when Tom discovers that the farm has been raided. The chests he been taken and his brother Jack and his family kidnapped by witches and carried onto Pendle. Tom learns a lot of new things and gains experience. Its really shocking to see the sufferings and the disastrous circumstances in which the Ward family is trapped. We even get to see the second Ward child, James, the blacksmith who will be playing a minor role in the following books. Alice, after getting at Pendle gets a little bad and involved with witches, but mind you most of them are benevolent expect the Dead Maggie. I really like the characters of Mab, she is so much like Alice and still very different, even Marmalde is great. She is terrifying and malevolent, she talks much more than he does. I personally think that the book focuses on two major things, that are the ""Chests"" given to Tom By his Mam and the rise of the ""Fiend"", that's the Devil for you. I just love the ritual by the witches and the rise f the devil, I mean now that he's unleashed he will destroy the county for sure! He's a dark god. Even the fact that the chests contains feral Lanka witches is surprising and surely hints that Tons Mam is not else than a lamia witch, but that a domestic one. The book follows a straightforward and fast paced plot with a lot of action and movement. A lot of things happen in the book but not like the previous book. Thy happen one after another and not at the same time. I really lobe the parts like rescuing Alice, in fully rating Malkin Tower, the ritual of the witches and grimalkin chasing tom and as usual, the end is captivating and irresistible. Signs of the Spook being terrified due to fiend are also shown. He is surely getting weak and old and weary. Tibb, a seer and an ugly one is so much boring.  That reminds Mr, the book also introduces Grimalkin, the witch assassin the most powerful with assassin and torcherer  in the County.(or is it the world) as is one of my favorite char centers with a great personality, and amazing skills paired with mind blowing costumes. The meeting with Wurmalde completely alters the plotline. A very immersive, captivating, fluent, lucid, entertaining book. But I would say that you should only read it once, unlike me. Great story.

The end obviously, what else? Delaney provides another great supplement to the Wardstone Chronicles, one that will surely hook you and make you realize where the series is going to end. The plot is absolutely amazing and we come back to Tom's PoV narration after the previous book. This was my first time reading the book so I was excited to read new things. And new things are what I got, a new region, new alliances, new enemies, new darkness, new threats and most importantly, a new Dark/ Old God, Siscoi, the vampire God of Blood and also the ritual to destroy the Fiend permanently.  The end was unexpected and very surprising, something reader could have ever thought. I would really recommend you this book, if you have to finish the series and get satisfaction, this is a book that you should really not skip. It starts with a good recap of the past events along with character introduction and situation and progresses slowly in the beginning. Things really seem to be good and jolly in the beginning, but as you'd expect 'happiness doesn't last forever' is Delaney's Motto, especially regarding the Wardstone series. So, things go bad really soon as soon as we reach the third chapter. Its really saddening after all that Tom has done to see him so devastated after reading Mam's letter and misunderstanding about her feeling. But that is nothing compared to when he gets the news about the Ritual for the destruction of the Fiend and for that he must kill Alice with his own hands. The three blades, of which two Tom already has, namely, the Destiny Blade and The Bone Blade are also brought into light. And Alice has grown powerful, more powerful that I could imagine, even powerful than Grimalkin, obviously not in combat but in dark magic. She is a very useful ally in the book. The book highlights the issue where Tom repeatedly hears Mam's voice inside his head as she guides him, in the beginning as well as the end. After this, the book can be divided into two parts, <br/>1)Getting into Todmorden, a town at the edge of the County <br/>2) Ascension and Destruction of Siscoi, an old God<br/>I would say that the latter part is much more better than the first one. The first one drags the reader very slowly and is not very attractive but introductions couldn't be given much better. It just adds to the storyline and gives an idea of whats to come. The town is planned well, mostly focusing on the people and the 'Transforming' house which is haunted by the strigoica spirit and its male spirit. This specifies that the book has a heavy Romanan influence with Roman witches, spirits, ghasts and Old Gods that threaten to infiltrated and darken the county, The real thing begins when Grimalkin arrives in the town, then things just get very very exciting that you can't wait to finish the book. The action and the combat scenes are just enthralling and full of excitement. Another thing I forgot to say, a new ex-apprentice plays a very major role in the first half of the book, namely Judd. He is ever helpful, but the cause of the 'Spooks' fake death. The talks with the Fiend, the ascension of the Vampire God, side quests including the retrieval of the boggart, the ritual to awaken Siscoi, the final battle and the gripping end which is just unexpected are the things that I like about the book. Let us speak about the characters. I no longer traeat the Spook as a major charachter henceforth, he is not much active in action nor does give Tom any 'important' lessons. By my point of view, Tom has already surpassed Old Gregory who has grown weaker and weary. Grimalkin, has become a major character and fights with new motive and spirit, substituting for the Spooks lack. As i mentioned, nothing is more powerful in the book than Alice. The dark artifices are also brought into limelight. Especially, the grimore 'Doomdryte', would influence the plot of future books surely. And even the three blades are required to carry out the ritual. Speaking of Tom, he is more mature, responsible, grown, strong and a hunter of the darkness. He does not cower and gets scared of anybody, thanks to his training by the Spook, Grimalkin and Arkwright, he has grown so much and seen things at such a young age. The book provides a very satisfactory point of view narrative which makes is so engrossing. It really ticks me off about the fact that at least one major must surely die in the end, that will happen at any costs and the darkness keeps rising, the servants of the the Fiend keep rising and substituting those who have been defeated. Even the boggart seems to be back and things at Chipenden are now settled but much more things would be happening in future, things I cannot imagine and would be a surprise for anyone. The encounter with the Romanian witches, the moroii, the haunted Roman spirits and ghasts (both male and female versions) , the dark Vampire God are so well crafted that it just leaves you fascinates and wanting more. This book is unique, ventures into unexplored areas, gives a reader a broader and a wider view of what's to happen in the future, contains strong gore, violence and a lot of bloodshed (Frequency has risen greatly in last 2-3 books due to which  I rate them as 12+), provides a great story, emotional and relation building, change in situation, the coming of new generation, new Old Gods and terrifying creatures of the dark and illusion that one cannot bear to see. Paired with gripping storyline, combat, witty and economic dialogues, readers will devour this book. I would also like to add that the story was unnecessary made more intricate in the first half of the book. It is full of surprises and character traits that have never been explored before (i.e Alice's use of dark magic, Grimalkin's urge for using dark magic, Tom's maturity, Spook's degradation,etc, etc) Things are really growing darker and it will be a huge surprise to see how things end. The characters have been shaped very well and realistic, both the protagonists and the antagonists, I have almost nothing to say against the book. A real treat and delight to read which inspires us and motivates us to read more. That is the magic of Joseph Delaney. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

But still, now that I review the final chilling conclusion to the Wardstone Chronicles, I gotta give my best. This series has really added joy and magic to my life, it has entertained me beyond compare and given me a tumult of emotions and a roller coaster ride with its fast and furious plot, appeasing narration, great storyline, and unique characters, and memorable illustrations, nothing could be better! As per as my views, this is the 'Best' book in the series, and surpassed what I hoped for. I knew some spoilers but still, it provided me a very enchanting experience. Now, after the last three books by other narrators, it feels a lot good to return back to Tom's storyline and how he interprets things. He is a very strongly and powerfully built character that will leave and impression and influence on the reader, surely! The book follows a steady plot, with furious combat scenes. The plot can be dissected with the help of arcs:-<br/>1)Getting Back the Fiends Head<br/>2)Preparations for War<br/>3)The Wardstone Battle<br/>4)The Time Travel+Conclusion<br/>After the last three book, this storyline is unique and it feels as if we are back in the mainstream and the centralized idea of the Wardstone Chronicles. We are back in Chipenden, where it all began, ''Old' School''. New characters, locations, abilities, weapons make their appearance like the willmaker, Lukrasta, Katrina, the new 'breeds' of witches, the Wardstone(A Very Prominent Location as you will find out), the Dark Tower, Halloween, Starblade, etc. The fact that Alice, turned to the Dark just grabbed me and surprised me beyond the senses.  Her reference with the doomdryte was matching after all, but the fact that ticked me off that she preferred to live with Lukrasta just by glancing in his eyes, Alice Deane should have had a better reason for suddenly turning towards the dark. Maybe it was because, the dark moon grew up to it's full size, due to the overuse of Dark Magic by Alice, but that I leave on the readers to decide. This changed the storyline completely, this is not at all predictable. Alice seems a very different, and a distant character as compared to previous book. She is no longer the sweet young girl, but a dark witch who just wandered off with a stranger. I would say no more about her, but only that she just completely altered the end of the Wardstone Chronicles. Tom has now become the 'Hunter' and that he has gained a lot of new abilities, thanks to him 'Lamia Blood', he seems very fascinating and determined. The book  just progresses with grace, giving Tom all the freedom for his narrative. He is a very influential and a powerful character. I bet you will be overwhelmed when you reach the last couple of pages of the book. Another issue of interest is Lukrasta, the dark mage and a powerful servant of the Fiend himself, the first reader ever to be alive after reading the dark grimore, Doomdryte. His appearance and character traits are very much recognizable. He plays important roles during the end of the book and may be considered as the major antagonist. I personally think, that the main attraction of the book was the Spook. he signed his will, prepared his coffin earlier, renewed his enthusiasm and finally gave his life by fighting for the light, John Gregory is at the Paramount of his efforts in order to banish the dark, a very influential and major character, but sadly he dies in the end, teaching us a lesson that not all good things remain forever. Grimalkin has also become a major characters and helps in developing new blades, and displays her talent in almost all combat scenes. Unlike, the previous 'grim' novels, it does not seem much dark and bloody in language, but surely the reader has a quite 'original' Wardstone experience that drives you crazy, maybe due to Chipenden, Brewer's Farm and the main characters coming together. Almost all the characters of the series take their place at the dark and the light sides and fight each others to their death. The emotional interaction of the characters is done exceptionally well and all the secrets that Tom has been keeping from his master come out like a flood.The boggart 'Krutch' plays an exceptional role in slaying most of the witches. The writing style of the first half of the book varies greatly with the writing style of the second half of the book. The beginning of the book was especially well. There are vast and huge references to the new 'Starblade Chronicles' series where the Dark God Talkus of the Kobolos people rises and slays the entire population of the world. Delaney attempts to finish a series and begin another in the same book, but joins the line very well which does not make it appear as completely different elements/Subjects. I like the idea of the 'Time Travelling Wardstone' and its great features at the end of the book. It just inspires you to read more and more. I feel so overwhelmed when looking back to the simple days when Tom and Alice were daft enough to deal with a simple ghost or a rank 1 witch and I really miss the lessons that the spook used to give in the earlier book, with the motto ' Dark Days, Dark Times' applies very well here, though the storyline is not completely embedded with a grim outline. The series has grown so much and the end was a lot more than just satisfactory. This is one of the best and the most memorable book series I have ever read!

We see a lot of new character here but not those who we love the most. As compared to it's predecessor, this is not that good but still worth reading. Maybe it is because the style of writing completely changes as we see things through the eyes of the witch. Its like 'we know the characters but still they feel distant' even if the book is from the same series, but don't interpret me wrongly, this book is surely worth your time and is much shorter, probably just as much as the Spooks Apprentice and even as good as it. The story continues where it was left in the Spooks Destiny, Grimalkin is in a situation  where she has to keep the Fiend's head secure and fight the other servants of the dark who chase her constantly in an attempt to bring back the Fiend back into power. But they don't know that what they are dealing with is Grimalkin, the deadly assassin whose blades kill people before they even realize. There's a lot of bloodshed and gore here so just as an exception, i would rate it as a 12+ book which stands distinctly different from the series. The plot consists majorly of running, hiding, killing, eating, healing and again running, eating, healing, fighting, hiding which sets a monotonous environment for the reader and is the major setback of the book. The plot is just the same, running from enemies, making alliance, enemies destroy alliances and you are back to running which makes it somewhat boring but for some young readers it may be exciting. There are new locations explored, the plot mostly takes place at Pendle, Malkin Tower, the castle, witch dell and the seashores. The illustration, the title of the chapter and the quotes of Grimalkin just below are just fantastic and a  new addition. There are new servants of the dark like the Krutch 'a dark entity created by witches just to kill Grimalkin, a powerful mage, and a band of around 50 witches. That's a hell lot of enemies. But in the end, Grimalkin just kills them all. A lot of gore, blood, violence and torcher is seen throughout the book with use of bloody and nasty language. As I said, this book is 'different'. The plot goes slowly, very slowly in the beginning and just fast forwards in the end giving the reader a roller coaster ride.  Most of the book keeps fluctuating between the present and the past of Grimalkin and how she faced a variety of opponents and gained experience.  A new character of a girl named 'Thorne' is introduced and focused very much upon. She is like an apprentice to Grimalkin who has been secretly trained by the latter. A lot of attention has been given to 'Thorne' but she dies as well, but she is just as important as Grimalkin in the book. Grimalkin's major motive here is to keep the Fiend's head away from the dark and give enough time to Tom to get a way to destroy the Fiend for once and for all. There are many death including that of Agnes Sowerbutts, A lamia witch who guards the Malkin Tower, once a major character in the Spook's battle, Thorne, a character I will never forget (She is unique and she is talented!!!), the knight, and around 40 witches.  Around 5 short stories are also described in the book about Grimalkin. Another major flaw of the book is that Grimalkin is portrayed weak and meek and sometimes cowering, the author surely wouldn't have meant this but this is what the readers experience as she keeps running, getting hurt, begging for alliances and shelter and gets her best apprentices and allies killed. Also, Grimalkin's all talk, she just keeps speaking (let me rephrase, thinking! ) that she Almighty but just keeps running after being poisoned and getting captured. She is sometimes very weak and sometimes very powerful which seems controversial. But all this gets covered as she seeks her revenge in the end, which happens very fast unlikely to my taste. The character of the Krutch is very formidable and truly horrifying. It is martial, talented and a potential threat to Grimalkin and really makes suffer throughout the story, so that adds spice to the plot. Some parts were truly enjoyable but some parts were extremely boring and now I really look forward to Toms point of view narration, which I really like. A great book, could have been much better, amazing illustration, plot, characters and language. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

I always dreamt of completing The Wardstone Chronicles so here I am, making a second try. So let's start from the beginning, the cover art was really eye-catching. The illustrations above each chapter are also remarkable; The chapter title astute. The ""Not to be Read after Dark"" warning surely gives the reader a hint of what's to come. The book starts really well with a good point of view narrative by Thomas Ward. The description of each member of the family and the farm is done very nicely, but not in a monotonous way. The character building is done skillfully, obviously of Tom but also other members of the Ward family and Alice, Spook, etc. It's interesting to see Tom so meek and oblivious in the beginning but as soon as he's the apprentice to the spook he starts learning all the new things and develops a sense of responsibility and awareness, as a result of his mistakes. The family troubles in the county are also highlighted. The ""Seventh Son of The Seventh Son"" issue is given a bit more importance but I think its valid because we don't get so see such cases every day. The story follows a steady pace with a straightforward plot and nothing too complex for readers to understand if they read it with interest. Its my recommendation to first time readers, this stuff will surely make you hooked to reading YA genre. The story develops and brings in new characters, each unique and with a great personality. Even the speaking style of each character differs and the reader gets a delightful experience. Obviously, the most interesting thing in the book is the story, the dark and grim setting (not much) and the dialogues. The story and the plot is great. I like the Watery Lane Part, Meeting with Alice, The Spooks Teachings about Bogart's and Witches, and the battle between Mother Malkin and Tom. The detailed description of the witch and the Bogarts is good enough to give the reader a somewhat pictorial view of how they would appear. The dialogues are witty, Delaney does not waste a word without conveying something emotional, or material. The enlightening quotes about moral conduct by Mam (Toms Mum) and the Spook are a delight to read. Another interesting feature of the book is the portrayal of nature and the Spook's House at Chipenden. Tom's narration style which makes you go on reading. I'm in love with boggart, a very funny creature that the spook keeps. The house is big with a library, with scientific and astute knowledge about a topic. The Spook is surely a ""great Dark-Dueler"". The book even highlights some emotional feelings about loneliness, responsibility, anger management, mistakes and the right path to follow.  Mam, Alice, Tom and Spook are the most prominent characters in the book. The character of Mam is Wise, enlightening and benevolent. Spooks is hard, secretive,  weary and sometimes humorous. The most difficult to explain is of Alice. She's a bit good and a bit dark so its difficult to explain. I really pity Tom as he is made through go through all the difficult stuff and test in just a month of his entry in the Spooks apprenticeship. I did not at all like Mother Malkin. She failed to scare me. I did not even like how she could just be a wick and be 1/3 rd of her size. The costumes of Spook is also good, a black cloak and a rowen wood staff. I love the words written by Tom in his journal in the end, particularly the last sentence. ""Now I'm just an apprentice, but one day ill be the spook.""<br/>This was surely a memorable, cherished, entertaining, somewhat frightening, enlightening and ""pleasure to read book"". Recommended for everyone. (10+). Nice Reading",,,1,0

I finished this in a single day. Its bigger than the previous book. But not at all compromising the style of writing and the captivity. One thing I noticed is that throughout the book, their is a melancholy emotion. Every single chapter has some hint of melancholy and sadness whether it be the poor victims of the Quisitor, the history of the little people, desperate and hopelessness, helplessness, the corrupted priests of Priestown(Love the town name), Alice's suffering, Toms Dads I'll health, etc,etc. There's a lot of violence and sadness as compared to the first book. But there isn't much horror, excluding witches and all. There's just much action, thrill and adventure. Tom seems to have grown very much and already seems a professional Spook. But he's got a lot to learn at the same time. Alice comes into a limelight, getting a very major role and influencing the storyline heavily. The bane, on of the strongest old gods is revealed in the book as the villain, he has breathtaking and somewhat scaring abilities, powers and appearance. He almost seems a legend and a myth. You can get his image in the Spooks Bestiary. The style of writing is extremely well, but as I remarked, there's a lot of sadness, which may upset a few readers. Many things have been happening at the farm too. Toms Mams abilities and history is revealed, Tom begins to suspect shes a witch. Alice suffers a lot, a lot in the book. I really pity her. Throughout the book she suffers the beatings of the Inquisitor, The Bane Possession, Spooks Harsh words and a lot of blood loss. But in the end, she's a happy soul. The little people, who worshipped the bane. I like their history. The spook seems much more weaker and suffers from his old age. The encounters with the Quisitor and The Bane are really enchanting, they just keep you hooked. This is totally a page flipper book. The description of Priestown is great, though I don't like it as good as I like Chipenden. The priests and their atrocity is very well highlighted by Delaney. Character development is totally great. Dialogues are wittty and to the point. The book also has a short backstory of Mam, Spook and the Bane along with the Little People. It reveals the relations of the spooks and the developing of friendship between Tom and Alice. Tom seems more skilled, but disobedient as always. <br/>I like the Boggart capture, entering Priestown, Mams backstory, her letter to Tom, the bands dialogues (especially the ones at the end), The qui suitors death and the possession of Alice. The ending entry from Toms journal is very inspiring. I this Delaney overdid the priest and athe church thing a bit but it just adds some magic to the story. Nothing g negative to talk about. A very delightful, remarkable, awesome, fantastic, marvellous, page flipping, enchanting book that hooks the reader. Great stuff. Just grab it. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

The series is just getting better and better with each page. You can feel the characters growing with each breath. It's so wonderful to see how Tom has grown do much since, he became the Spooks apprentice, both physically and mentally. He is more passionate about being the Spook and is confident and responsible. Sometimes lazy, but still passionate. This book has 3 antagonists, namely, Morgan, the Spooks Ex-Apprentice, who has taken the dark path, Golgoth, An old God who can bring ever lasting winter and Meg Skelton, the spooks love. There are a few new characters too who are prominent like Shanks, the delivery man, Andrew, the locksmith who is the spooks brother, Marcia, Megs Sister, The Hurst family,etc.etc. <br/>A lot of things happen in the book. I would classify them as an arc. According to the ""arcs"" the story is like <br/>1)Farewell to Chipenden<br/>2)Meeting Morgan and Arrival and Anglezarke<br/>3)Fighting the Stone Chucker (Boggart)<br/>4)Toms Fathers Death<br/>5)Morgans Demand for the Grimore<br/>6)Megs Escape and The Spook's Secret<br/>7)Awakening of Golgoth and finally<br/>8)Return to Chipenden<br/>As I said the plot is very simplistic but with a lot of things happening altogether. At the farm, Tom gets Tr inheritance of Man's room. This is the least expected and surprising moment. Mam reveals her opinion about going back to Greece to sort out the dark. Toms Dads death is very saddening. This marks that Toms childhood is over due to the passing of his dad and leaving of his Mam. This gives him a more experienced personality, and also he has completed an year as a Spooks apprentice at the end of the year. He has learnt to practically us his knowledge and prowess. He shows his skills in the book a lot. Noe let's talk about Alice, she is not as prominent as she was in the previous book but she is still a major character. She informs Tom about Morgan and is very helpful to him as well as the Spook. Tom and Alice develop their friendship and he traits her a lot more now. Even the spook seems to trust her a bit more. This is probably because of Meg, his first love. This is a bit of controversy, him Tom to stay away from pretty girls and him, having a relationship and deep feelings for Meg, who is also a witch. Meg really and strongly affects the Spook. This is the Spook's secret. We see a lot more of Andrew and he's very helpful. Now let's move towards the Antagonists, firstly I don't think that Morgan should have been the villain in the book. He is inexperienced, halfwit, a liar, showoff, and does not have complete knowledge, and most importantly he is a human. Humans aren't supposed to be the antagonist of the Spook's series.  But I like his skills of manipulating the dead, training the atmosphere cold, conjuring and summoning the dead and his speciality, necromancy, but its tiring to see how he uses his skills to torch Toms Dead Dads Soul. He is really dark and mysterious but inexperienced. Meg and Marcia are really scary, especially Marcia who eats birds in the attic. Its really gross. The illustrations will really scare you, they are so attractively horrifying. I would rate this book as 12+ for just that reason. There is a bit more bloodshed in the book. Speaking of Golgoth, the winter god, he does not make much of appear nave but I bet he's terrifying. <br/>Delaney has really portrayed Anglezarke a darker, Colder, uncomfortable and unsocial town in the county. The icy atmosphere, the grim people, the unstable cold weather with blizzards and the moors really match with ASOIAF/Game of Thrones ""Wall"" really well. Its almost similar. The spooks winter house is much big, but lonely. Its has almost 10 rooms with an additional attic and a cellar. Now, the cellar is probably the most terrifying and scary room that you can find in the house. It has big pits where ghastly and despicable lamia witches are prisoned. A lot of story happens in the house. The herb tea that is given to Meg is also a practical and major part of the story. Its really interesting to see characters grow, Spook's secret coming out, his emotional health, the grim characters, the deadly old gods rising, and family deaths and parting happening in the book all at the same time. A really good and a well planned book. Recommended to all. (12+) Nice Reading",,,1,0

Again, for the fifth time in the row, the story takes place at a different place than the Chipenden. This time the destination is Greece, the home of Tom's Mam and the antagonist is the Ordeen, yet another powerful malevolent Old Goddess. This is a very different book from the series, and its pace is not steady. Sometimes its too fast and sometimes too slow. I just have to say that it is full of emotion though. The plot is straightforward with one thing happening at one time, but takes a lot twists and turns. I won't bother to get into the story as you will find it anywhere. It mainly focuses on revealing the secrets of Tom's Mam (Mother). A lot of dark secrets and backstories follow as our young (and old) heroes get towards Greece. The book starts with an attack from the maenad assassin and then slowly the story starts developing faster and faster and then there's a lot of action and fight scenes, a lot of then. I'd like to inform you that there a only just  a few lessons in the book given to Tom by the Spook. I personally think that there's a lot of new characters introduced in the book but most of them die, so that's not much of a big deal.  I think that the plot of was slow in the beginning but i read it very quickly and later after the interlouge, the plot went very faster and it seemed that I read slow. It may seem controversial but it's true. I read this book for the fourth time, so there was not much of a surprise for me but still it was enchanting, especially in the end. There's a lot of change in the charachters, especially that of Tom and Alice. they seem distant and grown up and full of sadness. I don't know why but they do not seem to have their original qualities. Things have really grown darker after the summoning of the Fiend. (Damn those Pendle Witches!) I hate to break it to you but the most major character in the book after Tom is not the Spook or Alice but Tom's Mum. She may even be the central character. It's odd to see Mam summoning all those Pendle witches for help, the Spook and Tom think that its too dark and unnecessary for the witches to be an ally. The Spook just overdoes it, thankfully at the last moment he joins he team for their journey to Greece along with Mam. Sometimes, the Spook annoys me too much as he keeps talking how the dark influences Tom to get towards the dark side. To my Amazement, the book brings back amazing characters like Bill Arkwright, Grimalkin, Mab Mouldheel, the Fiend. The journey on the ship is also remarkable, with the attack of the Sirens and all. But most of the story takes place at Greece and what a great description! I must surely thank Delaney for such a great detail about the climate, landscape, bio-diversity in Greece. It seems as if you yourself are roaming the great arid deserts. As I said, Mam reveals a lot of history about how she was the first lamia witch and her conversion to the light and how she wants to bind and destroy the Ordeen once and for all. I love the storyline of the attack of lamias in the night, Alice's death in the cave(don't worry, Tom saves her using the Dark wish given to him by Grimalkin), approach to Kalambaka which is a town in Greece consisting of monks who pray for the light. Now, the most interesting that that I would like to inform you about this book is the architecture and the detailing of the Ord which is a large building in which the Ordeen will awaken. It has got hidden chambers, defence barriers made up of fire, traps, demons and elementals hidden in it. The creatures in the Ord are nothing compared to the ones in the county. Once, the delegation of thirteen consisting of Tom, Spook, Alice, Grimalkin, Mab are inside the Ord the story flows much faster and impressive. It just hooks you to read and complete the book. First, the impressive fight between Grimalkin and the servant of Ordeen is just gripping. Later, the result of the Or seen being released is shown to Tom by the devil and even reading it makes you shiver. All those flying vengars and the demons flying with Fiends unlimited backup of power is terrifying. There is not even a bit sign of joy and happiness in the book, which makes it monotonous and very serious. Arkwright gets killed while fighting an elemental. That was very sad. The next most interesting thing is the bargain with the Fiend. Tom risking his soul for the greater good is just heroic, not really. Then, the moment comes when atom faxes the Ordeen herself, at this moment you really realize that Delaney has planned this book very carefully, taking in consideration the minute details that will influence and change the plotline. Toms blood makes the Ordeen appear confused and gives him a few abilities. Anther skill of Tom is brought into spotlight, namely the ability to mock the tide of time as the Ordeen calls it. I forgot to tell you that the Ordeen look really gross, not scary but weird. And the moment Mam reveals her lamia form, its the moment that you will remember till the end of the Wardstone Chronicles, its unforgettable. Mam tries to ell Tom about his destiny and her sacrifice for him. This is surely a very emotional situation. The it's breaks as Mam and Ordeen fight and both die. Later, Alice saves Tom yet again from the Fiend, whoc arrives to takeTom's soul. I personally think that Tom does not turst anybody, not evn his Mam for some time. I think the Fiend has clouded his judegement, and rather than it being the Spook's sacrifice, I think that Mam was the real one to sacricie herself, so there. There's alot of inspirationin the book, especiailly in Mam's letters. It really motivates Tom to forget abou the past adn get ahead in the future. A great book, with a lot of sadness, action, journey, growth, inspirationand advenunture. A real treat for the Wardstone Chronicle fans. Just let me warn you not to read this book more than once or it really spoils the magic, you won't be amazedif you readt it more than once or max twice. Nice Reading!!!",,,2,0

This is probably the best book ever in the Wardstone Chronicles. Its just so awesome, that I'll have to write a bigger review. So let's begin, the book cover is just awesome with Arkwright and his blood hounds with a misty green back round. It really sets up a terrifying atmosphere. Its the second time I read the book, the first time I didn't enjoy it but now it just has broken a food deal of records. It literally makes me happy and full of joy, but enough of praise. I read this book in digital format on kindle as usual, but in the European edition with the title ""Wrath of the Blood eye"" which refers to the empress of the water witches and the daughter of the Fiend (that is the devil), Morwena who is the primary antagonist. Now, the book is bigger than the others if compared, took me 3-4 days to read. The title is aptly given, as the plot completely changes due to a single but a disastrous mistake by Bill Arkwright, the Spook of the Northern Caster region. So, there's a lot of things happening in the book, all extremely well written and a delight to read. The book starts as the ""Press Gang""hunt for young children and try to make them forcefully join the army, Tom, barely escapes them with Alice's help due to which the spook decides to send Tom at the Northern Caster to Bill Arkwright,  a local Spook who is an expert on water witches and everything that's related to marsh and dampness. As i mentioned before, Morwena along with the Fiend are the central antagonist. Both of them are terrifying and horrifying but I always find the Fiend very mysterious with no major motive and a dark appearance, which makes him insuspectable. Even the Spook is scared of him and fears for Tom. Alice, shows a lot of her dark side and her association with witches as she uses mirrors to contact, witch bottle or I'd rather call it blood jar, and contacts the deadly witch assassin Grimalkin to request her to help Tom and also using ""Dread"" to rescue Tom from the press gang. She has truly become one of the major characters and very prominent but i hate that the Spook treats her as filth and never ever completely trusts her. She shows her dark side a lot of times in the book but she also states that, ""To Fight the Dark we need to use the Dark sometimes"" which is truly a very true sentence, but i promise that Old Gregory couldn't accept so. Its also revealed that she herself is the daughter of the Fiend in the end. I think I'm not going step by step. So i'd rather start at the depiction of scenery and nature. Joseph Delaney has truly done a wonderful job. He has portrayed the Northern Caster even better than he did Chipenden. The dark forests, the damp marshes, the open and tall valleys and mountains, inns, Arkwright's house, the haunted mill, the coastal areas with witches lair, etc,et.  All this atmosphere really adds to the story and gives it a richer complexion.  I really like the hermits staying place, the haunted mill, the bridges, the island and many other things like the barge. The story is also really well created. It just addicts the reader to read and read. I would say that the book goes a bit more faster as compared to the previous books. I like Arkwright's unique character and personality but i totally hate his drinking habits and when he suddenly grows angry. His library and knowledge about the water witches is a competitor to the Spooks . He is in his youth and follows different methods than the Spooks so we get to see a lot of new things. Tom really has a hard time north of Caster, he is missing Alice, having exhausting lessons everyday, getting beaten for his curiosity and whenever he tries to help anyone, he gets jumbled and imprisons himself. But he gains a lot experience. There's a lot of water witches in the book, they are described very well which gives chills to the reader. Morwena is just great with her bloodeye ability that can freeze anyone and that finger hook through which she can drag her preys below the swamps. Even, Grimalkin comes into Spotlight in the book, I really like her with all her weapons and costumes and all mighty attitude, she is truly the queen of witches I would say. she becomes a major character at the end of the book as she helps Tom to finish off Morwena. Even as the Fiend is broken loose into the world we see him and his true form for the first time, and his greatest and the most fantastic ability to tamper, stop and speed up time. This is so Cool! I especially like the parts of story when, Alice uses dread, Tom visits the haunted mill, the compete training of Tom under Bill Arkwright, encounter with Morwena, the blood hounds (Claw and Bone, but sadly one of them dies. If you see the cover they are really scary and blood thirsty. Really good for witch hunting.), Arkwright's Alcohol addiction, his knapping by Morwena, Toms runaway, the Spooks trap, rescuing Arkwright, Grimalkin's entry and all the encounters with the devil and the fighting with Morwena in the end. i love Toms and Alice's emotional conversations. They are so addicting. Arkwright's drinking habits tick me off. Even the ghosts of his parents are boring and unnecessary addition. I did not like the adventure of the seal woman very much. It just wants to male you read more and more I think this is enough and my review will inspire you to read this fantastical, thrilling, magical, describing, delightful, page-turner and somewhat scary book from the promising Wardstone Chronicles. I've already started with the next in series. Hoping to finish soon. Nice Reading!!!",,,2,0

Inside the Great Glass Elevator, Willy Wonka, Charlie Bucket and his family are cruising a thousand feet above the chocolate factory.<br/>They can see the whole world below them, but they're not alone. The American Space Hotel has just launched. Lurking inside are the Vernicious Knids - the most brutal, vindictive murderous beasts in the universe.<br/>So grab your gizzard! Hold your hats! Only Charlie and Willy Wonka can stop the Knids from destroying everything!<br/><br/>{Storyline}- The story picks up immediately where the previous book left off, with Charlie and his whole family aboard the flying Great Glass Elevator. The Elevator goes into orbit by accident, where Mr Wonka docks them at the U.S. Space Hotel. Shortly after their arrival, the hotel's elevators open, revealing man-eating monsters, known as Vermicious Knids, which form a letter of the word 'SCRAM'. Recognising the danger, Mr Wonka orders everybody off the Space Hotel. Upon the Elevator's departure, the monsters consumed some people aboard. Charlie suggests towing the shuttle back to Earth. Whereupon Willy Wonka returns the Elevator with the shuttle to Earth, the monsters are incinerated in the atmosphere. Mr Wonka releases the shuttle, and the Elevator then crashes down through the roof of the chocolate factory. Back in the chocolate factory, three of Charlie's grandparents refuse to leave their bed. Mr Wonka gives them a rejuvenation formula. They take much more than they need, and they each lose eighty years. 78-year-old Grandma Georgina vanishes, having become ""minus two"". Charlie and Mr Wonka journey to 'Minusland', then Wonka restores her with a sprayable compound that makes people older. Grandma Georgina has become 358 years old. Using a cautious dose, the three are restored to their original age.<br/>Finally, the President of the U.S. invites the family and Mr Wonka to the White House, as to thank their rescue in space.<br/><br/>{Characters}- Recurring characters from the first book along with the President t of USA, Space Knogs (Wierd Creatures!), Astronauts,etc. More or less the same. All these are quite funny, their dialouges beyond imagination. Mr. Willy seems more Frank and open minded now. The President of USA is the most funny character that you'll encounter in the book. His nanny is remarakble. Charlie has developed somewhat and has become more responsible and guides his elders (the grandma's and grandpa's) throughout the book. Mr. Bucket is fancy. The characters interact with each other very well and some emotional highlights can be seen too. In the first half of the book we also get to know the space astronauts having very similar names and the rhymes and poems dedicated to them by Dahl are truly great. The Space Aliens Knogs are horrible. The characters can easily be imagined thanks to the fascinating illustrations by Quentin Blake. In the second half of the book, the Bucket family steals the limelight and grabs the show. The chaos regarding ages is indeed humourous. The older characters are given a wee more importance. The Oompa Loompas are as fascinating as they could be. Mr. Wonka's true motives are unveiled. The President is a simpleton.<br/><br/>{Scenes}- The story and scenes can be divided into two halves. The Space Hotel arc and the Wonka Vite arc, both of them interesting but following a very different plotline. In the first half, we see some ironical but entertaining story taking place in the glass elevator. The space hotel description and the usaul introduction by Mr. Dahl. We also see the Knogs aliens which have vital importance in the storyline. Now, the amazing thing is that fear, humour, tension, comedy are intertwined with each other an presented before us. But comparitively I liked the second half much more.  Back to the gold old chocolate factory and the earhtly fun. We kick start by Oompa Loompas poetry. Then the scenes regarding Wonka Vite and Vita Wonka are truly enchanting. They captivate your attention and you'll read much more quickly. The journey to Minusland and the magical turning young and old is a very beautiful and imaginitive idea. <br/><br/>{Locations}- Locations include the Space Hotel, the Great Glass Elevator (very important and funny, mind you), chocolate factory and the White House. The space hotel is described very well. Much of the action and horridness takes place in the great glass elevator orbiting in the space. Later the location switches to the Chocolate Factory and Minusland. <br/><br/>{Speciality}- A powerfully written childrens book that will captivate them. Contains much more action and adventure. Look out for those wonderful rhymes and poems.<br/><br/>{Notes}-  The book involves fancy drama and catchy quotes. It really makes you laugh out loud. Recommended.<br/><br/>{Remarks}- None.<br/><br/>{Rating} 4/5",,,1,0

Charlie Bucket is the hero. The other children in this book are nasty little beasts, called: Augustus Gloop - a great big greedy nincompoop; Veruca Salt - a spoiled brat; Violet Beauregarde - a repulsive little gum-chewer; Mike Teavee - a boy who only watches television.<br/>Clutching their Golden Tickets, they arrive at Wonka's chocolate factory. But what mysterious secrets will they discover? <br/>Our tour is about to begin. Please don't wander off. Mr Wonka wouldn't like to lose any of you at this stage of the proceedings . . .<br/><br/>{Storyline}- 11-year-old Charlie Bucket lives in poverty in a tiny house with his parents and four grandparents. His grandparents share the only bed in the house, located in the only bedroom. Charlie and his parents sleep on a mattress on the floor. One day, Grandpa Joe tells him about the legendary and eccentric chocolatier, Willy Wonka and all the wonderful sweets he made until the other sweetmakers sent in spies to steal his secret recipes, which led him to close the factory forever. The next day, the newspaper announces that Mr Wonka is reopening the factory and has invited five children to come on a tour, after they find a golden ticket in a Wonka Bar. Each ticket find is a media sensation and each finder becomes a celebrity. The first four golden tickets are found by the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled and petulant Veruca Salt, the gum-addicted Violet Beauregarde, and the TV-obsessed Mike Teavee.<br/>One day, Charlie sees a fifty-pence coin (dollar bill in the US version) buried in the snow. He then buys himself a Wonka Bar and finds the fifth golden ticket. The ticket says he can bring any family members with him to the factory and Charlie's parents decide to allow Grandpa Joe to go with him.<br/>After meeting Mr Wonka, the kids and their parents go inside where they meet Oompa-Loompas, a race of small people who help Mr Wonka operate the factory since he rescued them from poverty and fear in their home country Loompaland. The other kids are ejected from the factory in comical, mysterious and painful ways - befitting their various greedy characters and personalities. Augustus gets sucked up the pipe after falling into the Chocolate River in the Chocolate Room, Violet blows up into a giant blueberry after sampling an experimental three-course chewing gum meal in the Inventing Room, Veruca is thrown down the rubbish chute in the Nut Room after the nut-testing squirrels consider her a ""bad nut,"" and Mike gets shrunk after he tries to be the first person to be sent by television in the Television Room's Television Chocolate Technology. With only Charlie remaining, Mr Wonka congratulates him for ""winning"" the factory and, after explaining his true age and the reason behind his golden tickets, names Charlie his successor. They ride the Great Glass Elevator to Charlie's house while the other four children go home (Augustus squeezed thin, Violet all blue in the face, Veruca covered in rubbish, and Mike stretched ten feet tall). Afterwards, Mr Wonka invites Charlie's family to come live with him in the factory, and they do<br/><br/>{Characters}- As this is a children's book Mr. Dahl has kept the characters as simple and minimum as possible for ease of reading, however adults can easily notice the subtle behaviour characteristics. The illustrations make it quite easy to imagine the character personality. But let's not go in depth. Among all the characters all are entertaining, most funny, some solemn, none boring. Charlie bucket is the primary character whose poor economic background is highlighted in the first few chapters. I truly like Mr. Willy Wonka character- funny, entertaining, cheerful, inventive, bright and somewhat mysterious. The only fictional character are the Oompa-Loompas, dwarf men (or whatever they are!) Working in the chocolate factory. The children in the book have a unique personality which is seen through chronicled events. Charlie's family is adorable but suffers due to backward economical condition. Overall, a nice cast of characters (for a children's book).<br/><br/>{Scenes}- My, My! Immensly enjoyable scenes throughout the book. Some introduction in the first few chapters and then we kick on to the real story. Each chapter covers one major scene. The beginning is well laid out. Chapters are small, scenes are delightful, entertaining, colourful and bold. The narration style is aimed for younger readers. I just loved the Poems by Oompa Loompas, their wit and stature and everything that comes along with it. Mr. Dahl truly has a good sense of humour and enriched vocabulary to present such good Poems in the book. The scenes are highlighted with many emotions - sadness, joy,  happiness, surprise, amazement, shock, relief, awe-inspiring sights and what not! (I'm running out of adjectives). The scenes inside the chocolate factory are truly wonderful, be careful to read each and every word carefully, you'll be amazed. The author tries to teach the young audience various lessons through particular scenes where each character is eliminated (in amazing ways!) From the factory tour. Surely recommended for young children and adults too... The author is very creative with his writing and ideas and expresses them fantastically. Wonka's chocolate inventions are beyond imagination, I'll not spoil the fun for you. Go for it. The ending was simple awesome. The book is sometimes predictable, sometimes it's not. <br/><br/>{Locations}- primary locations include the town (unnamed) and Willy Wonka Chocolate factory. Most of the story takes place (along with the fun stuff) in the chocolate factory. We have the chocolate fountain, chocolate manufacture rooms, televison chocolate, squirrel centre, inventing room,etc. Where a lot of fun stuff happens. The locations are described very well and are narrated in a creative style. The child in you will be satisfied after reading this. Also, the great glass elevator is another major location. The factory is the primary epicentre of the book where most of the interesting stuff happens. <br/><br/>{Speciality}- A great evergreen children's classic that impressed readers, young and old alike. Very creative and imaginative narration. Passable illustrations. Teaches valubale morals to younger audience. A quick read (just hundred pages or so).<br/><br/>{Notes}- I just love the Poems. Strongly recommended to younger audience. Great for literature study purpose for older readers.<br/><br/>{Remarks}- Nice Reading! <br/><br/>{Rating} - 4/5",,,1,0

Snicket really tries hard to keep the story of the Baudelaire's at tit's peak, filled with tension and woes but here, he tries it a bit too hard and makes it feel cringed and repetitive, almost like a story narrated to the babies. It gets way too childish and not at all grim and dark like the previous installments. The series has reaches a  new low and I was actually bored by the chapters 4-8! Frankly, this was everything that was wrong with the story.Everything else was astonishing, wonderful, marvelous and addictive, if not foul and despairing. Snicket's description of the Austere Academy, the principle characters such as Nero, Genghis, The Triplets were remarkable and second to none addition in childrens books that complement the story. The 'momento mori' slogan, crab-filled rooms, seeing Sunny as a school authority admin, S.O.R.E sessions and the absurdness of the school was totally bizarre. Except the middle chapters, everything from the book was thoroughly enjoyable. From, the past book I've noticed that Snicket has a way of introducing the Baudelaire orphans to some good-hearted strangers who guide and assist them through their hardships and tribulations. Here, Duncan and his sister, the Quarelmire Triplets connect the story and are really worthwhile to read.   The character development is very much noticable by the end and all the three children have matured from their 'prism of experience.' There is something cheesy called as the V.F.D teased and I'm very much enthusiastic and interested to find out what that will be in the following installments. THe ending left me astonished as it broke the series of regular pattern that the author followed while concluding the storylines. Count Olaf disguised as Genghis also plays a distinguished role in the story. The ending leaves the reader with a mild cliffhanger. The climax peaked my interest. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

There's a huge paradigm shift in the story line and it's a relief, though I oddly found myself missing the monotonous plotline in the previous books, it just can't get out of my head. The book begins, twists and turns and concludes very differently as compared to previous books in the series. Matter of fact, Snicket actually answers some of the questions. I read through the book very quickly, took my almost 2 days. This was fast-paced, action filled and ridiculed with dark humor as always. Snicket has changed his approach to writing the books or has he? I found myself flipping the pages quickly quenching my curiosity whether a miserable guardian shows up or about Olaf's next vile scheme but everything falls into place once th Baudelaires arrive at the Heimlich Hospital. The events in the past books play a key role in this one and I absolutely do  not recommend you to read this without gazing upon the previous installments. Sunny has actually and officially become a toddler and is much more helpful and witty that she ever was and her conversations have become more rational and helpful. She is right at the top of my favorite characters in the series. Sadly, we do not see Mr. Poe in this story at all but the recurring appearance of Elise, Olaf and company will surely keep you thrilled. The operation, discovery about a possible alive parent, the ending and the arrival at the hospital were some highlights from the book that had me hooked. I really pity Hal's character. Snicket has frequently poured in poems and nonsensical rhymes with odd chords and guitars in the pages but they seemed bare to me. A fantastic book which marks a new saga and sets up the stage for the dramatic ending of th Baudelairs adventures. Don't miss this. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

The horrendous and foolhardy village is one of the latest and the most terrifying addition to the misfortunes of the Baudelaire's. The book behind very well with a dramatic appeal and Snicket's annotations are lively and unique this time. The entire plot was well-planned with addition of new characters, surprising return of a few characters and mysteries let hanging in the air. The first half of the book went quite fast but slowed down disastrously at the second half but then, as always, the climax picked up momentun and delivered never seen before action and a variant conclusion. The truth of things is that we don't see much of count Olaf in the last couple of books. I don't know why but it takes away the horridly enjoyable part and the stuggle between the ""rich"" orphans and Olaf is from a distant and not close up which reduces the appeal. The part with the riddles felt repetitive to me. Other than that the book was perfectly well written with engaging and poetic comments, Sunny's immense character development, the bonding between Baudelaire's and Quagmires. Jacques character added a plot twist to the story. The theme of the Vile Village worked perfectly with the storyline and all the absurdity and nonsensical behaviour of it's residents and the villages geographical grimness should be totally witnessed by ASOUE fans. I would have never expected that climax. We can see the stakes getting higher and a lot of turning qestion left in the air, still unanswered. Maybe it will all fit in the end. I'm very enthusiastic to reach the series' conclusion and be amazed. This installment adds up a lot of new elements, plotlines and the usual sarcastic narration to the series and for that it deserves credit. Some parts of the book were a bit dull but they are easily covered by the surprising and engaging story twists and narratives. Strongly recommended to ASOUE readers. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

We see a lot less if Snicket's wide and humorous and factoid full narrative and even count Olaf's disguise as Gunther is not at all menacing. It has almost become a stalemate at this point and Snicket really needs to do something about this. We obviously do not get many answers from the previous book but Snicket does an excellent job to make us much more curious by adding yet another ton of mysteries and can plot connections. The dark avenue building which becomes the best home for the Baudelaire's is highlighted by what's 'in' (what's treding and worthwhile to do) and what's 'out' (what's not tending and not worthwhile doing.) which changed the impression of the book as these two words becomes the backbone of the story. The Quagmire's tragedy continues with them being locked up in a thousand metre deep Esratz (A fake) elevator hallway. Don't send to have grown up a bit. Violet and Klause think and act more prudently as they now have the firsthand experience at tackling Olaf. Olaf almost causes no trouble with the Baudelaire's directly, he actually speaks a maximum of  5 sentences to the Baudelaire's which is a big letdown. Trust me, most of the part of the book is about climbing up the floors and climbing down the floors, dark passageways, hallways, fake elevators and how tired one gets from climbing 66 floors. It isn't a surprise that this book hits a new low. But along with this there is a brand new content and visual scenery teased and vividly represented by Snicket. The restaurants, the auctions, the trending things in the Baudelaire's world, the reunion and (sorry, but can't help it) the breakway of Baudelaires and Quagmires at the end which was just like the previous book with almost no distinction at all. Snicket's snippets are mildly entertaining but not laugh out loud, he does an excellent work adding facts, Easter eggs and references regarding science, history, literature paced evenly throughout the book. The beginning was exceptionally good. It was a relief to see the Baudelaire orphans being cared in a 70+ room penthouse. This is the book where they suffer the least and are find themselves hunting Olaf to rescue their friends. A nice addition to the series but the second half could have been way better.

The book works wonder with a limited number if characters each unique in their traits. The wide window has a much darker setting, location and characters than any previous ASOUE book. The setting near the Lachymore Lake is itself a bit grim, I always visualize the locations, houses, architecture in books and the illustrator does a good work of acting upon the readers imagination. Violet, Sunny and Klause is this installment find themselves in care of a distant relative Aunt Josephine, who fears almost everything and is traumatized due to her husbands death in the Lachymores. Her interaction with the children is very much worth reading. What adds to rhe entertaining factor of the storyline is the added tension, apparent death of their aunt and the ingenious coded letter which is much associated with Josephines grammatical endeavours. Count Olaf follows the same fundamental idea and I'm guessing the same will be done in the next installment too. If you know what I mean there is a whole lot of misadventure and action in the book fueled by the weather conditions and geographical location if the narrative setting. Honestly, these books are so good to read out loud. Mr. Poe, as always makes a return too Chase off the malevolent Olaf. Snicket's comedy commentary and ironically puns are like cherries on the top. This keeps getting better and better. Just add a few new elements and let the story twist a little and Bam! There's a masterpiece. I'm positively in love with the Baudelaire orphans and how I pity them! Recommended to all my young friends out there. A must read. Nice reading!",,,1,0

The book introduces new dramatic and humorous characters such as Mr. Montogmery Montogmery who acts as a legal guardian of the children and eventually dies as Count Olaf returns to a despair filled plot. The ingenious idea behind the book was mostly the idea of how adults are so sure of themselves and won't even consider the suspicions of young ones.  Anyways, the dark humor and nitty-gritty story is always satisfying and heartwarming in a way. Snicket does not even hesitate to give spoilers and declares a few chapters each ahead of a major characters upcoming death. The narration style of Snicket introduces new puns, ironical explanations and daffy definitions. Young Sunny is growing up and her speech highlight any particular event.Violet is all fired up and does not hesitate to take a move against Olaf as he does not seem as formidable as he was in the Bad Beginning. Klaus' love for book is linearly growing and he does put it to a good use.

The beginning of the book was very interesting as a whole new crew of characters were introduced. The boss man, The optimist and Charles who genuinely cared for the children. It's preposterous to read about the Baudelaire children's caretaker has no face reveal nor name identification in the book (as it's too complicated to spell). Each of the secondary new characters add a comedy and nonsensical dramatization to the story. The children's hopes of a good and Caring guardian are smothered get again as they go through the chores, accidents and hypnosis induced injuries. The wide cat of characters add compared to the previous book makes this installment a bit better but after a couple of decent chapters the cliche jokes get a bit dull. But then the story hops back into action. This book is full for mild surprises as Count Olaf makes good appearance in the latter half of the book and his identity is rather masked. I was fascinated as Snicket put Klause into the hypnosis storyline and intertwined the foreshadowing pun 'lucky' using it to his benefit. By the end of the book the children thankfully have at least some luck by their side and are about to survive from the Jaws of murdering a colleague. Snicket's narration and series of enlightening passages are triggered at the right timing in the book to eliminate any note of monotony. Nice Reading",,,1,0

I hardly remember a children's book I enjoyed through and through other than the Wizard of Oz series and then this just hit me right in the face. I mean, Lemony Snicket is a master storyteller, she clearly knows how to keep the audience entertained. The story revolves around an orphan trio who actually face many unfortunate events within a span of few weeks.<br/><br/> Here's an official synopsis:-<br/>In this book, the Baudelaire children become orphans after a mysterious fire destroys their mansion, and supposedly kills both of their parents. They are sent to live with a dismal abusive guardian named Count Olaf in his filthy house, where they are treated like slaves, physically and emotionally abused, and under threats of death. They also discover he is scheming to steal their inherited fortune and will not hesitate to kill all three of them once he obtains it. <br/><br/>Maybe the reason I enjoyed this book so much was it's limited yet unique and dramatic cast of characters, engaging storyline, short and sweet chapters and astonishing illustrations. That's what the book is all about in a nutshell plus a lot of abuse, bad adult behavior and tragic events that young Violet, Klause and Sunny have to face. Count Olaf's character was utterly terrifying, not for me but from the children's point of view. This is a sort of book (and I hope the series too) which is suitable for children as well as adults because it has a sort of foreshadowing, intertwined narration style, Gothic representation of variety of elements which children cannot notice and still enjoy reading and adults surely notice which enhances their reading experience too. For me, this is exactly what I was looking for. The story felt really short but memorable. Snicket's daffy definitions and explanations make this a hilarious read-out-loud book which cannot be missed. I'm planning to binge watch the Netflix TV Show when Season 3 hits the small screen. For me the adults in the book such as Justice Strauss, Mr. Poe give the readers a big message that adults make mistakes too which can change the course of young people's lives. I conclude on the note that this was a heartfelt book, a totally enjoyable and relatable read. Even the foreword, dedication and letter to the Editor by Snicket shows her interactive approach which really enhances the storyline and sets a dark tone for the reader. Perfect for juveniles and early teens! Nice Reading! <br/><br/><br/>",,,1,0

The end is truly astonishing and unbelievably crafted. The narration is simple, straightforward which some may find dull but still the content is totally worth reading. I mildly liked Sue and Eddies personality. The best part of the book was the conclusion. The book is one of its kind in the goosebumps universe as it marks time travel as well as a human antagonist depicted as the executioner. Also, the atmosphere is gradually developed.

Almost like the first one but recruiting nor character  and  a grand big pyramid. Sari and Uncle Ben are back and I still love Saris attitude and competitiveness.<br/>The story is not much gold but gets well and progressive but is not scary in the least. There are a few connections about the ancient  dummy and the relics. I like the parts about the new discovery and the character of Nils but apart from that the book is dull and boring.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Gabe Sabry is flying back to Egypt to attend the grand public opening of the pyramid Uncle Ben was excavating in the last book. Uncle Ben and his daughter Sari pick Gabe up from the airport and they drive straight to the pyramids in Giza. Uncle Ben informs Gabe that instead of a hotel in Cairo, they will be staying in the Pyramid Hilton, his name for the tents lining the exterior of the pyramid.<br/><br/>Uncle Ben announces that he and his team are very close to breaking the seal on a tomb inside the pyramid. As Uncle Ben walks the children to the pyramid's entrance, a mummy staggers out and attacks the three. Except it is not really a mummy at all, but a guy dressed as a mummy making a commercial for ""Sticky Bird Bandages.""<br/><br/>Uncle Ben gives Gabe a necklace with a pendant made of amber. Inside the amber is a scarab, which Uncle Ben explains were sacred insects to their ancestors. Sari thinks it is a dumb present, but Gabe wears it with pride. Sari tells Gabe that the scarab beetle somehow came out of the amber and is crawling on him. Gabe feels a pinch on his leg and remembering that Uncle Ben warned him that a scarab bite meant instant death, he falls to the ground howling in horror. Except that the scarab never left his pendant and the pinch came from Sari, who knelt down and pinched his leg. Gabe is upset, but Sari feels she should not apologize.<br/><br/>Over breakfast the next morning, Uncle Ben tells Gabe about the tomb they are opening. Ben believes it belonged to King Tut's cousin, Prince Khor-Ru, and could be filled with millions of dollars' worth of valuable jewels. Or it could be empty, a trick tomb to fool grave-robbers, Ben casually warns. After breakfast, Sari tells Gabe that she is worried about her father. He is really set a lot of his hopes on the discoveries inside the tomb making him famous and she is afraid that he will be really depressed, if there is nothing inside the tomb.<br/><br/>Uncle Ben hurries over to the children and drags them into the pyramid, as his workers are ready to break the seal. He gives the children yellow hard hats with lights to wear. The three don't make it very far inside the pyramid, before they are stopped by a beautiful woman dressed in a white pantsuit. The woman introduces herself as Nila Rahmad. Nila is a reporter for the Cairo Sun and she wants permission to accompany Uncle Ben as he opens the tomb. Ben consents, as she claims to have run this idea past Ben's partner, Dr. Fielding. Nila asks Sari and Gabe, if this is their first time to be in a pyramid and Gabe says it is.<br/><br/>Nila admires Gabe's pendant and shows him her matching necklace-- only hers doesn't have a scarab inside. Ben tells Nila a bunch of stuff about the pyramid in a clumsy attempt to impress her. Gabe complains that it is cold inside the pyramid and he should have brought a sweatshirt.<br/><br/>Almost immediately, Gabe gets lost and does not know how or why. Gabe stops wandering the tunnels of the pyramid and leans against a wall. He then leans through the wall as he tumbles into yet another secret hidden chamber. Inside this chamber are thousands of white spiders. The spiders swarm over Gabe, as a rope ladder finds its way down into the room.<br/><br/>Uncle Ben and Nila hoist Gabe back up and Gabe takes out his mummy hand to make sure it survived his fall. Gabe is shocked when Nila asks him if it is The Summoner. It figures that the one character who would remember anything about the previous book wasn't even in it. As the other characters turn around to make their way back on course, Gabe looks down at the mummy hand and sees the fingers twitching.<br/><br/>Two days later, Ben's workers finally prepare to break the seal to the tomb. Ben gathers up the two children and Nila and they head down the pyramid. Ben prepares to chisel away the soft gold seal, when he hears a booming voice: ""PLEASE- LET ME REST IN PEACE!""  They all turn around and see a lanky man. The man crying out is Dr. Omar Fielding, Ben's partner. Dr. Fielding tries one last time to reason with Ben, to not break the seal. Dr. Fielding reminds Ben that the hieroglyphs on the door warn that anyone who repeats the ancient chant written on the door five times will return the mummified prince to life. Dr. Fielding refuses to be privy to incurring the mummy's wrath and flees the pyramid.  Ben chisels away the seal and pushes open the door. Unfortunately, the inside of the tomb is completely bare.<br/><br/>Undeterred, Ben makes the entire crew enter the bare tomb and begin work on removing the gold seal off of another door found in the room. After working all day, the workers remove this seal, and behind the new door they find a large mausoleum filled with pots and chests of treasure. The tomb appears to have once been a meeting room, as inside they find a long table, chairs, and a large throne. The attention of everyone in the tomb soon turns to the stone casket resting against a far wall.  Ben and three of his workers slowly lower the coffin to the ground and slide off the lid. Inside they find the tar-stained, mummified body of Prince Khor-Ru. Suddenly four men burst into the tomb, waving guns. They announce themselves to be with the Cairo police. Dr. Fielding saunters into the tomb and tells Ben he changed his mind and called the police to come and guard the tomb's treasures. Ben wearily accepts the help of the police, as he has no choice.<br/><br/>That night, Ben, Nila, and the children are eating dinner around a campfire in the desert. Nila has her arm wrapped around Ben and wants him to tell her the six words that will bring the mummy to life. Ben finally gives in and reveals them to be ""Teki Kahru Teki Kahra Teki Khari."" Ben scurries away to do some work in the communications tent and Nila heads back to her office in Cairo. Back in their tent, Gabe comes up with a plan to scare Sari, to get her back for all her pranks. He recites the correct chant five times and Sari is visibly disturbed.<br/><br/>A gruff figure accosts the children in their tent but it turns out only to be Dr. Fielding. He tells the two youths that he must find Ben and the two children decide to follow him for adventure. As they watch from a safe distance, they can't tell whether Dr. Fielding is leading Uncle Ben towards the pyramid or just resting his arm on his shoulder as they walk quickly across the sand. Dr. Fielding appears to push Ben down into the pyramid's entrance and the two children agree that since they do not have flashlights, they will have to wait outside the entrance. Gabe tells Sari that he saw the four policemen leave earlier in the afternoon, meaning that Dr. Fielding and Ben are alone in the pyramid. After waiting about an hour, Dr. Fielding emerges, alone, from the pyramid. The children try to catch his attention, to ask where Sari's father is, but Dr. Fielding just runs away into the night. Gabe tells Sari to stand guard at the entrance in case her father comes out while he runs back to the tents to grab some flashlights. When Gabe returns, Sari signals that Ben did not come out. The two children head into the dark pyramid, alone.<br/><br/>Sari can't remember the exact route that leads to the prince's tomb, but Gabe spots work boot prints in the sand and the two follow the tracks into the empty tomb. They see no sign of Ben, until Gabe notices that the lid to the mummy's casket was now closed. It was open when they had left earlier in the day. The two slide the lid off and find Uncle Ben tied and gagged inside. Dr. Fielding had left him to suffocate sealed inside the casket. Gabe and Sari realize at the same time that if Ben's in the mummy's coffin, then where's the mummy? Right at the entrance to the room, and he is heading right towards the children!<br/><br/>Gabe tries to yell for his uncle to save them, but he's passed out inside the case. The two children maneuver their way past the mummy and into the empty room. They run right into Nila. They plead with her to help them, but she gets angry at the children and tells them that they've ruined everything. Nila produces Gabe's mummy hand, which she stole from him, and uses it to call the mummy closer. She reveals that the mummy is her brother and she is over 4,000 years old. Now, thanks to Gabe's Summoner, she and her brother can reign over Egypt again.<br/><br/>She calls on her brother to kill the children, but the mummy walks right by them and instead starts choking his sister. ""Leave me in peace,"" the mummy groans as he assaults Nila. Gabe tries to break up the mummy murder and accidentally pulls off Nila's amulet. It crashes to the ground shattering into a thousand shards. She howls out and tells Gabe that the pendant was how she stayed alive all these years. At night she would revert into a scarab and climb inside the amber. Nila shrinks down into the scarab beetle and scurries away into the dark pyramid.<br/><br/>Dr. Fielding bursts in, surrounded by police. Turns out Dr. Fielding was not forcing Ben into the pyramid earlier, he had just seen Nila trespass inside and wanted help in stopping her. Then when he ran to get the cops, he was so frantic that he did not bother to stop and reassure Sari. Well, that's the end of that caper, gang.<br/><br/>Back inside their tent, Gabe is bragging about his accomplishments to get back at Sari. Sari jokingly warns that Nila, the scarab beetle, could still be after him and he should look out she says ""Watch she will be waiting for you under your covers."" Gabe climbs into bed and utters in horror ""Ouch",,,1,0

It sure is a mystery book and you cannot suspect whats going to happen next but you burr can determine something  about the characters, his likes and dislikes and opinions. The book wasn't scary at all. Most of the time, our hero reads comic books, takes a bus ride, visits the ""Alien"" Mutant Building, the architecture of the building is very beautifully described by Stine. I love the idea of what happens in the comic happens in real life. investigates it and battles the Mutant. I wonder how he felt like when he fought his favorite supervillain. It would be great if the Masked Mutant had a back story. The ending is just perfect, with character switching and illusions and how the Masked Man was killed. I think that the masked mutant was so very easily killed. The girl character was also great. (She was the Masked Mutants assistant really) this book invades the young mind who like comics and action sequences. Not a remarkable one from the Goosebumps NotSoHorrifying series.<br/> Danger does not approach our hero here, instead he approaches and searches for danger. Its all because of curiosity. Well, curiosity killed the cat<br/><br/> Skipper Matthews is an overweight twelve-year-old comic-book collector who loves collecting many comics yet only reads one: the Masked Mutant. The Masked Mutant is an evil super-villain who can change his molecular form into any solid material. He is constantly opposed by a league of superheroes lead by the Galloping Gazelle, the world's fastest man. Skipper has a friend named Wilson who is into collecting rubber stamps and attempts at various times throughout the novel to share his passion with Skipper to no avail. Skipper also has a little nine-year-old sister Mitzi who always likes to mess around with him.<br/><br/>One day while riding the bus to the dentist, he meets a pretty redhead girl named Libby (not knowing that she was actually the Masked Mutant in disguise), who strikes up a conversation with him about comic books. He gets so caught up talking to her that he gets off on the wrong stop and spots a building that looks exactly like the Masked Mutant's headquarters! He almost goes inside the building, but he is late for his dentist appointment and decides to come back. The next day he comes back to see the building but it has disappeared. Later that night he goes home and reads the newest issue of the Masked Mutant that has arrived in the mail for him and sees that in the comic book the Masked Mutant has put an invisibility cloak on the building.<br/><br/>Going back the next day, Skipper runs into Libby for a third time. The two decide to see if they can access the invisible building and sure enough they enter successfully. When they arrive, a yellow light ray scans over Skipper's body but has no apparent effect on him. The two ventures into one of the building's elevators and are whisked down to the basement of the building. The two get separated and while alone Skipper finds a large printing press and layouts for the last issue of the Masked Mutant. Skipper concludes that the building is likely the headquarters for the comic book publisher. While leafing through the layouts Skipper notices a series of panels for the next issue, and the new character drawn within looks exactly like Skipper. At this point, Libby reappears and makes Skipper leave with her. That night, Skipper gets home and there is another new issue of the comic waiting for him.<br/><br/>Inside the issue Skipper spies drawings of himself walking around the headquarters with the words ""A NEW FOE"" written about him. Skipper also finds out that the Galloping Gazelle has been held hostage in the Masked Mutant's headquarters, and that only ""the Boy"" can save him.<br/><br/>So Skipper returns again to the headquarters and makes his way up the elevator to rescue the Galloping Gazelle! He finds the bound superhero tied to a chair in an unlocked room, unties him, and the two leave the room to confront the Masked Mutant.The Galloping Gazelle is convinced that Skipper is a superhero and keeps drilling him for his secret power as they make their way to the Mutant's private offices. The Galloping Gazelle informs Skipper that his plan is to run around and around the Mutant at such a fast speed that he becomes a cyclone and sucks the Masked Mutant into submission. Suddenly the Masked Mutant morphs out of hiding (he was disguised as office furniture) and the Gazelle makes good on his plan. However the Mutant outsmarts him and sticks his foot out, tripping the Gazelle. The Masked Mutant then transforms into the form of a leopard and tries to eat the Galloping Gazelle.<br/><br/>The Galloping Gazelle proves himself to be a coward as he escapes the Masked Mutant's leopard clutches and abandons Skipper with the Masked Mutant as he makes his escape. The Masked Mutant returns to his normal form and he too starts to drill Skipper about his secret mutant-power. The Mutant lifts Skipper all the way up to the ceiling of his private office and is about to drop him to his death when Libby appears in the doorway.<br/><br/>The Masked Mutant safely sets Skipper down as he goes to confront Libby. Libby removes a yellow toy gun from her satchel and tells Skipper that if this is really a comic book then anything can happen, so she tells the Masked Mutant that the toy gun is a Molecule-Melter. The Masked Mutant doubts her and he advances as she pulls the trigger. The gun fires at the Masked Mutant and the Mutant melts down into nothing. Skipper is overjoyed and Libby tells him of course it worked, after all, it is a Molecule-Melter, and Skipper is the next victim and target.<br/><br/>Skipper then watches as Libby transforms into the real Masked Mutant. It turns out that the previous Masked Mutant was actually theMagnificent Molecule Man, who worked for the Masked Mutant. What else matters is that, there is no girl named Libby at all after the Masked Mutant himself ditches his female disguise. The Masked Mutant also informs Skipper of another dastardly deed. He has turned Skipper into a comic book character, which turned into a big shock! The mysterious yellow ray when he first entered the building was a scanner and it scanned him into the comic book! With no hope of escape the Masked Mutant prepares to destroy Skipper until Skipper stops him by announcing that he is not actually Skipper! No, he is the Colossal Elastic Boy in disguise. The Masked Mutant shakes his head and says, ""I knew it!"" Skipper reveals that nothing can harm him, but sulfuric acid. Skipper throws a bucket of water onto the Mutant which makes him melt into a wave of acid. Skipper barely misses the wave and the acid eats into the carpet.<br/><br/>Skipper made up the whole thing about being the Elastic Boy. Since the Masked Mutant could only transform himself into solids, Skipper had tricked him into transforming into a liquid and thus the Masked Mutant was unable to return to his original form. Skipper was very happy to be alive and performed a little victory dance, on the carpet. He could not wait to return home and see his family again. It seemed like the bus ride home took hours, but as soon as he got home and walked into the front door, he was glad to be back. He had enough adventure for one day, and decides not to read the new comic that has arrived for him in the mail. ""Who needs it?"" he asked himself about the comic. He then, celebrates his victory later on that night, by playing Frisbee with his little sister Mitzi for a half an hour. They had a great time. Then Skipper asked his little sister Mitzi if they wanted a snack. She said yes, and they decided to have some chocolate cake together. As Skipper is cutting the cake with a big cake knife, he accidentally cuts the back of his hand. But he discovers that it was not blood coming out...he was bleeding red, blue, yellow and black ink. Looks like Skipper's comic book career is not over yet and now he must read the next issue of the Masked Mutant comic series in order to continue.",,,1,0

This time the horror master brings us Worms!! Works that are out for revenge! Or are they? It is for you to read and find out. To main character is very different, worm-loving, self caring , and a naught person. He has a great sense of humour and can tackle humane situations easily but is also very easily scared and suspicious. His friend has a good sense of humour and supports him. This time its the sister who plays the prank on her brother. There is no straightforward plotline that follows the story. The book is okay, not very great, it doesn't seem horrifying or scaring one but its just full of pranks and jokes and teasing. That's all.  There is a big worm seeking revenge at the third last page though. But introducing something scary at the end of the book does not really work. This book is more like a teenagers comedy and stressful life. Its completely different and fails to horrify and scare the reader. I like the Science Exhibition , Beginning, and the bathtub scene and those jokes and scares but this was not a very noticeable book from the Goosebumps series.<br/> <br/>Plot<br/><br/>Todd Barstow loves worms. He loves digging them up on the baseball diamond behind the school after it rains, loves collecting them in an aquarium in his basement, and loves tormenting his sister Regina and her best friend Beth with them. Luckily his best friend Danny always gives him a hand in collecting worms, even though he does not quite share his friend’s enthusiasm. Todd is known as that child who always wears a Raiders cap and loves worms.<br/><br/>Todd's planning on entering a worm house in the Science Fair. The Worm House is a wood house with worms inside. Todd learns that Patrick, a rich blonde good-looking child, is also entering a worm-related project in the Science Fair. Todd becomes obsessed with finding out what his project is, to ensure that his will be better than Patrick's. Regina tells Todd Patrick's address and Todd and Danny set off late at night to first meet with Patrick to try and get an answer from him. Later when they see his mansion is abandoned, they decide to break in and see his project. Then an evil spirit dog chases them and they see a corpse inside the house and run away.<br/><br/>Todd overhears his sister the next day talking to Beth on the telephone about what a great trick she played, sending the two boys to the abandoned mansion where some children threw a Halloween party a few months ago. Todd gets revenge on her by putting worms in the beak of the paper mache bird she has created for the Science Fair, which she has named Christopher Robin. Regina accidentally opens the bird's beak, when the Science Fair judges walk by and they land on the head of the judges.<br/><br/>Patrick sets his project down next to Todd's modest worm house and reveals that he has built a massive worm skyscraper, complete with working elevators. The judges spend a considerable amount of time on Patrick's project, mostly ignoring Todd's. Todd is furious, especially since he is the worm expert.  He had even refused to let Danny help him with his project, leaving Danny to build a solar system representation made out of balloons, half of which deflate by the time the judges come around. The judges announce the winner of the Science Fair, Danny and his balloon solar system.<br/><br/>Todd goes back to digging up worms out by the baseball diamond. Danny and Todd have been noticing a low rumble every time they go out to the diamond to dig. They even embarrassed themselves in front of the student body by proclaiming they were experiencing an earthquake.<br/><br/>Todd collects a bucket of worms and carries them back to his basement, where Regina and Beth are hanging out. Todd shows them a ""neat"" trick: he takes a worm and slices it in two. The two halves continue to wiggle forming two worms.  Regina tells Todd that the worms in his fish tank are watching him, that they know what he did and they're not happy, that they will take their revenge on him. The next day, Todd's baseball cap is filled with worms.<br/><br/>Todd then begins finding worms in his bed, his food, his homework, so on. He finally decides that Regina is right, and becomes so convinced that the worms are seeking their revenge that he sneaks down to the basement to apologize to the worms, where he is caught by his father, who is wielding a baseball bat. Todd's father tells him he has to get rid of his worms once and for all.<br/><br/>The next day at school, Todd walks to class in the pouring rain. When he enters the school, he and Danny overhear Regina telling her friend Beth about how she has been the one freaking Todd out, carefully placing worms all over his things to get him back for sabotaging her project. Todd drags Danny out to the baseball field to dig up worms after school. The rain has cleared and all the worms are coming out, the perfect time to grab some worms and get back Regina and Beth with them.<br/><br/>As Danny and Todd are digging around in the ground, they feel the rumble again and this time, a giant worm the size of a tree trunk pops out of the ground, grabs Todd, and drags him underneath the soil of the baseball diamond. Danny waves at Regina and Beth, who are walking along the edge of the diamond, to help him. They are busy carrying their paper mache bird, the shadow of which falls onto the baseball diamond, casting the shadow of a giant bird. The giant worm sneaks back out of the soil, sees the bird shadow, and releases Todd from his grasp. Todd decides to abandon his worm hobby once and for all by tossing his worms out into the garden, and he begins to collect beautiful butterfly specimens instead, much to the delight of his sister.<br/><br/>Todd is then awakened by a giant butterfly holding a huge silver pin who has shown up to take revenge.",,,1,0

This book really stands out from the Goosebumps series and would be probably one of my favorite. There is nothing horror or paranormal about this but its too thrilling, adventurous, mysterious and very cool. The characters are new and exciting. I love both the brother and the sister and the caring, genuine and frank Dr.D (What a weird name).<br/>I bet Stine must have done at least SOE research because I came along a lot of technical seafaring terms that I found interesting and I have highlighted them. The adventure of discovering new monsters and fairytale legend in the sea is thrilling. I was not looking forward to the book but the first few pages just got me stuck to it and I easily finished it in an hour and a half. I like the beginning, the coral reef, discovering the mermaid, understanding about her, deal with the zoo and the kidnapping. I'm not so sure that I like the thugs coming into the story and kidnapping the mermaid. That was a bit boring and also the ending was not so good. It could have been better. Still, the monsters and mermaid have been described exceptionally and feel almost real. The story is unique and thrilling and not at all obvious as its t is in most goosebumps books. I like the characters and the setting of the sea and the dangers that our band faces. This is probably one of the best works of R.L Stine. Not horrifying KR scare but a memorable masterpiece from the Goosebumps Series.<br/>Billy and Sheena Deep are spending their summer vacation on the Caribbean island of Ilandra with their uncle named Dr. Deep who goes simply by Dr. D. While snorkeling, Billy is nearly attacked by a Sea Monsterand manages to get away. Dr. D's assistant, a muscular graduate student named Alexander DuBrow, serves up lunch to the children: chicken salad sandwiches.<br/><br/>Only his cooking's terrible, so Dr. D offers to grill some fish for dinner. Billy overhears a private conversation between Dr. D and representatives for the Marina Zoo. The zoo crew wants Dr. D to find and trap a mermaid that has been reported in the area. The zoo offers Dr. D the princely sum of one million dollars.<br/><br/>Billy is too excited to sleep, so he goes out early the next morning at 6:30 AM to search for the mermaid. Billy's night swimming is suddenly interrupted by a hammerhead shark that almost kills him. Fortunately, the mermaid comes and attacks the shark, saving Billy's life. Dr. D nets up both Billy and the mermaid and drags them onto the deck of the ship. Billy tries to argue that the mermaid saved his life. But the mermaid is put into a large glass tank on the deck until the zoo crew arrives. Billy is enjoying dreams of Sea People when his slumber is interrupted by the sound of crashes and a splash. Above deck, he discovers the mermaid is in the process of being kidnapped! The men brutally toss Billy into the tank. Billy starts yelling for Alexander as Dr. D is knocked out on the floor and Sheena is offering no help against the four burly men. Finally, Alexander does show up only to side with the thugs.<br/><br/>The thugs toss Sheena and Dr. D into the tank, lock it, and then throw it into the water. The top of the tank is meshed, so the three characters inside the tank fight to break the locks before the tank submerges completely underwater. As they struggle, the ""kidnappers"" and Alexander speed off with the mermaid in tow. Just when things look their worst, a myriad of mermaids appear and hoist the tank above the water level. Dr. D and the children break open the latches and escape to the dinghy. As the other mermaids rescue her, the thugs attempt to set fire to Dr. D's dinghy. The mermaid is set free. Billy sneaks out by the coral again in hopes of catching the mermaid to say goodbye.<br/><br/>When Billy is searching for the mermaid, he is attacked by the Sea Monster which he encountered in the beginning of the novel.",,,1,0

The main theme is just the same and their are a few minor similarities. But the characters and the fast progressing story is what sticks the reader to the book. The beginning is great but the part from 40 to 60℅ is a bit dull but the story that follows is wah more better with a obvious conclusion. There are 5 kids in the book. Two living, three ghosts but are not revealed till the end. Its the highest number of major characters in Goosebumps and also the living kids do not believe in ghosts (at the beginning of the book.) I live the graveyard, the tombstone, the beach and the cave. Stone describes these natural structures very well. The discovery of their friends graveyard was something we saw in Goosebumps #1. The three ghosts are almost undetectable but after meeting Harisson the plot is so very obvious including to ending. A very good, quick, fantastic, progressive and fast read with a lot of twists and turns. This book can give you some goosebumps for sure. So pick it up and start reading. A considerable book from the Not- so- horrifying Goosebumps series .<br/><br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>The novel starts out with the Sadler siblings, Jerry and Terri, investigating a graveyard. Terri, the younger sister, loves making etchings of tombstones. While in the process of etching a tombstone, Jerry notices a pair of zombie hands shooting out of the ground. Terri and Jerry try to escape but it is too late as the zombie hands are clutched tight to Terri's ankles. It is all over, it is all a dream.<br/><br/>Jerry and Terri have been sent by their parents to spend a month on the beachfront with their distant cousins Brad and Agatha Sadler, an elderly but lovable eccentric couple. In the course of fooling around on the beachfront, the siblings meet a trio of young children flying bat-shaped kites. This sibling group consists of two boys, oldest Sam and toddler Nat and a young girl named Louisa, all three with the same last name as our heroes, Sadler and all three having the same freckle-pattern as the other Sadlers.<br/><br/>The Sadler Trio tells the Sadler Duo about how in the cave above the beach there lives a deadly ghost who comes out when the moon is full. After the group stumbles upon a skeletal dog that seems to affect the Sadler Trio a little too much, they explain that ghosts hate dogs because they can sense when they are around, so the dog was probably killed by the ghost from the cave. The Sadler Trio also tells the siblings that sometimes you can see a specter of light in the cave. Later, Brad attempts to convince the Sibling Duo that this glowing is merely the northern lights.<br/><br/>Of course, the lure of a ghost leads the duo to go investigate the cave. While inside, they find the source of the mystery light: it is actually being caused by the candles being lit by a creepy old man with long white hair and a thin gaunt body who lives in the cave. Jerry and Terri flee the cave and tell their new friends about the gruesome ghost they encountered. The Sibling Trio tells the Sibling Duo that they have a plan for stopping the gruesome ghost, from tormenting their beach town any longer.<br/><br/>The plan involves the Sibling Duo knocking over a bunch of rocks at the front of the entrance to the cave, thus keeping the ghost inside forever. The trio explains that the cave serves as a sanctuary and a ghost cannot escape from within, if it should be trapped inside. As the Sibling Duo goes to try to trap the old man inside the cave, they are accosted by the ghost and dragged within his lair. He sets them down in front of his desk and tells them the old man is not a ghost, he is their distant relative. It is revealed that the Sibling Trio are the ghosts. Even though Jerry and Terri had stumbled upon the graves of these three earlier in the book, somehow they have trouble believing this story. The old man tells them that he will let them go from the cave, if they promise to go check the far right side of the cemetery. It is his hope that they will return and aid him in trapping the three siblings in the cave by the same methods they had earlier suggested for trapping the old man.<br/><br/>When the sibling duo escapes and goes to check the cemetery, they see two freshly dug graves with their names on the tombstone. Finally the whole gaggle of children go to trap the old man ghost once and for all, yet the old man tricks the sibling trio into resting in the cave, which they are then bound to do. Then, finally, to prove that the children are already ""ghosts"" to the other children, the old man calls his trusty german shepherd. The dog goes crazy on the children revealing them to be ghosts to the surprise of our heroes.<br/><br/>The three children sadly admit they they died not only from the cold but from hunger and they never had a life at all. They then stare at the two human siblings and suddenly their ghostly skin peels off, revealing them to be ghosts. The horrible skeleton children are calling for the non-ghost cousins to stay in the cave with them and that they dug their graves for them. Jerry and Terri decline and the old man is trapped with the ghosts in the cave forever. The two human siblings go back to tell Brad and Agatha all about their adventure and the elderly couple is very relieved that the children are safe.<br/><br/>Suddenly the old man's dog conveniently bursts into the beach home and starts barking at the elderly couple. The couple are shocked that their secret is out. Agatha slams the door on the dog, as it continues barking outside. And Agatha asks to Brad, ""Now what do we do with these two kids, Brad? What do we do with these kids?"".",,,1,0

A silly name for some imagination but it adds a great mystery to the book. Out characters as in are a brother sister duo. I find Mike,the brother almost like me, lazy and a fantastic gamer and TV addict. The book takes us to the villages and the Shires of Europe and the great climate there and all the tress and the farm/barn life cheered me up to read the book. The house and the barn seems like a great vacation trip for the ""City Kids"" as Sticks calls them. I love the dark and the mystery setting of track book that hooks the reader from the beginning. The beginning is very joyful, exciting and comforting all those pancakes, chicken, fishing, sunny days it seems like a good village life. I even like the solemn and changed grandparents of our duo. Stanley is a unique and a great character Stine has created and the owner of the Superstitions book. It would be great if we would have got to see some passages inside the book which can bring scarecrows and other things(as we see at the end) to life. I think they overdid the scarecrow thing. The book is full of scarecrows from the beginning to the end. Just full of it and try don't look or behave so scary that you would freak out, not at all. I mean you could be surprised and confused but ""Freaked"" is not the word I would ever use. And even the grandparents and heavily built Stanley and his son are scared of scarecrows is a thing that I can't believe, they are just made of some hay and straw. What gives the book a nice background is the great and calm village life. I especially like the arrival at the farm, the changed grandparents and the observation of the kids, the fishing scene, the ""Scarecrow walks at Night ""dialogue"" , Stanley's and Sticks behaviour. The ending was not very great and the book gets much dull after 70℅. <br/>Anyways, its a quick read and very short, easy to understand and will keep you at you edge. If you are reading goosebumps you should surely pick pick this one up. <br/>The idea of the Superstitious book just rocks.<br/>Note:- I think this is the same book book from which a note must have slipped out in Mr.Woods/ Slappys waist pocket when hr comes alive.

It's a departure from the usual goosebumps series because the story and the characters are different too. I really like the beginning, how the  family gets lost and stumble upon Horrorland, a major and entertaining rest or amusement park by Mr.Stine. The characters have a unique and wide personality. Brave, concerned, wise,cautious, etc . There are a number if slides and rooms where one can enjoy (or die). It's good to see how characters react to difficult and intricate situations. Slide 1,3,10, Doom Slide, Mirror Palace, Coffins Ride , Monster Marathon are just great. There are a lot of signs that the visitor needs to see and pau attention. Very scary. The most interesting that about the book is or has Horrors who are the employees there. They are actually monsters but our family doesn't know about them till the end. The book has a great variety with a lot of unreal aspects an things that you could never imagine but after a certain period you can easily determine whats going to happen next. There are many bugs in the book. Many. How could Lizzie remember those ""No Pinching"" signs after so many horrifying moments and when she's going to die and then apply it in the circumstances that are so disastrous. I like how Lizzie's brother and his friend have different personalities. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>The Morris family is driving through the desert, searching for the Zoo Gardens theme park.

The story follows the same characters Evan and Andy who do keep their humble, playful and worried habits. But the background has been completely changed. New school, new town, new enemies and new teachers. I really miss Evans deaf grandmother. Even his dog is not a very big part of the book. This book was written very well but still wasn't enough to give me goosebumps at all. It may be too childish. The monster blood starts acting after finishing 85℅ of the book which is not good at all. Stine should have indulged the characters into messing with the monster blood a lot earlier. I really like Andy's character as she is always joking and playful. I think Stine overdid the hamster and the bully thing. That was not so necessary, but still its okay. I like the parts when they break into the bully's house, the clean of hamster, Evans worries and his problems(Does Stine not find some happy children for his stories?), the monster blood discovery (Yet again), the growing hamster. I didn't pike the part when Evan grows and smashes the hamster and the idea that the monster blood could have an export date is just hilarious but seems very odd and different all of a sudden. There were a lot of unanswered questions in the book such as where did Andy come from?? Where did she discover monster blood? His didn't the bully come to know that the monster blood he stole was stolen from him again?? And why didn't people just blamed Evan for feeding the monster blood instead of cheering him to grow up and fight the hamster. And I bet that a school teacher would not just appreciate someone when they just eat something and grow 10ft. Tall ""You should join wrestling'. That's so Unrealistic. What an unsuitable dialogue.

He picks up on this, while inside his giant dog's mouth. Evan frantically pleads with Trigger not to bury him in the backyard. Suddenly Evan wakes up screaming in his science class. Mr. Murphy, his science teacher, mocks Evan for having fallen asleep in his class. Evan calls his teacher dumb. Mr. Murphy punishes Evan by forcing him to stay after class to clean out the cage of the class hamster, Cuddles. Evan defiantly walks up to the hamster cage, plucks Cuddles from the wire structure, and hurtles him out the open window. Then that is revealed to also be a dream.<br/><br/>In the hallway after class, Evan is tripped by a bully with the name of Conan Barber. Evan informs the reader that everyone refers to him as Conan the Barbarian. When Evan first arrived to Atlanta, he tried to tell Conan the story of his adventure with Monster Blood. However, Conan declared that he ""doesn't tolerate wise guys.""<br/><br/>After helping Evan up off the floor, Conan offers him a free punch in retaliation for the tripping. Evan lightly taps Conan with his fist as Mr. Murphy wanders by. Mr. Murphy scolds Evan for taking out his aggressions on innocent classmates and sends him back into the classroom to begin the hamster cage cleaning.<br/><br/>Evan manages to lose the hamster. Eventually he tracks down the little guy and then proceeds on a chase. Cuddles escapes out the window. Eventually Conan catches the hamster and demands that Evan sing a song to get Cuddles back. Mr. Murphy shows up again and repossesses the hamster.<br/><br/>Walking home from his miserable day, Evan runs into Andy. Andy's parents are living overseas for a year.

Andy and Evan bury the tin in the forest.<br/><br/>Back at home, Evan visits his father, who has been crafting giant abstract sculptures out of sheet metal in the garage. Evan pauses in front of a giant aluminum cylinder that his father calls ""the Wheel,"" which has been accepted into an art competition held at Evan's school. The next day at school, he bumps into Andy in the hall, but can't chat because he is on his way to try out for the basketball team. As soon as he enters the gym, Evan is felled by Conan, who throws a basketball into his face. Biggie Malick, Conan’s friend, tells Mr. Murphy (who is also the basketball coach) that Conan was just tossing Evan's face the ball in a friendly manner.<br/><br/>After practice, Evan shows Andy his hand, which had been crushed by Conan in condolence after he failed to make the team. Andy comes up with a plan to get back at Mr. Murphy: They will dig out the Monster Blood and feed a small bit of it to Cuddles, just enough to turn the hamster into the size of a dog. However, when the two go to retrieve the Monster Blood, they discover it has been swiped, presumably by Conan. Evan accuses Conan of stealing the Monster Blood and Conan retorts by stuffing Evan into a locker.<br/><br/>Andy and Evan decide to break into Conan's house to steal back the Monster Blood. Evan complains that it is too dark to see anything and Andy snaps back that ""It usually gets dark at night.""<br/><br/>After Conan and his parents leave, the two prepare to sneak inside when Trigger shows up. Leaving the dog outside, the two children sneak in and make their way upstairs to Conan's bedroom. Andy spots the tin of Monster Blood next to Conan's tennis trophies and Evan decides to open the lid and stick his fingers inside. Conan and his parents arrive home while the two children are still inside, forcing Andy and Evan to sneak out the window and cling perilously to the concrete ledge outside. Conan turns on some rap music and begins singing and dancing. Conan's parents then call him downstairs to enjoy some cake and ice cream. Evan and Andy sneak back inside and make their way out of the house.<br/><br/>Andy manages to pull the tin of Monster Blood off Evan's hands and Evan makes Andy promise to bury the Monster Blood. She reluctantly agrees. The next day, Evan stays home sick, so he is quite shocked upon his return to school to see that Cuddles has grown to the size of a rabbit. Evan knows the Monster Blood is responsible, but Mr. Murphy blames Evan for overfeeding him. Evan feels betrayed by Andy, whom he is sure is behind the hamster's growth.<br/><br/>The next morning, Evan sneaks out early to check on Cuddles. As soon as he enters the science room, Cuddles breaks out of the wire cage. Evan thinks quickly and grabs a dog leash, tethering the dog-sized hamster to Mr. Murphy's desk. Evan skips class and meets Andy after school. She admits to having fed Cuddles the Monster Blood and insists she did it as a goof.<br/><br/>Evan meets Andy outside her aunt's early the next morning so the two can check in on Cuddles before class starts, but Andy has to change clothes and they end up arriving at school on time-- just in time to hear Cuddles, who is now ten feet tall, break free of Mr. Murphy's leash. Mr. Murphy tries to hold off the giant hamster like a lion tamer. He brandishes a chair and uses the leash as a whip. Cuddles simply takes the chair from the teacher and chews it to bits. Evan remembers that his father's sculpture is in the gym and it resembles a giant hamster wheel.<br/><br/>Andy and Evan wheel the giant sculpture up to Cuddles, who rather than run on the wheel, tears it apart. Then the giant hamster picks up Conan and prepares to eat him. Evan comes up with a new plan: He will eat some Monster Blood, grow bigger than Cuddles, and then lock him in the supply closet.<br/><br/>Evan and Andy run to her locker, which explodes open with a wave of ever-growing Monster Blood. Evan scoops a big handful of the goop and shoves it into his mouth. He starts to grow and makes his way towards the classroom. He confronts Cuddles, who is now roughly the same size as Evan, and the two start to wrestle. Unfortunately, Evan stops growing and the hamster easily overpowers the 10ft Evan. All hope seems lost when suddenly a loud popping noise is heard and both Evan and Cuddles shrink back to normal size. Evan walks over and easily captures the small hamster. Andy picks up the can and sees that the current date is also the Monster Blood's expiration date.<br/><br/>Evan is hailed as a hero for the way he ate some stuff and Mr. Murphy even rewards him by giving him Cuddles as a present. Andy has also received a present from her parents, a can of Monster Blood they found in Germany. Andy promises she will not use it, but she did already open the tin to sneak a peek. The book ends with Cuddles eating more Monster Blood.",,,1,0

There's no paranormal activity and no monsters until the last 2℅ of the book. What'd the use of reading goosebumps then? The book title ""You can't scare me"" is really true in my case. This book didn't scar me one but but it was more like a view to the life of a twelve year old boot who is normal and gets scared usually when things go wrong and how he wants to scare his classmate Courtney aka Miss Perfect. Eddie has four friends each with a unique personality and sense of humour. If you expect to be in for a scare this book is not really for you. It tells about the desperate plea of young souls and how they want to get s mild revenge about people those who are really hard to scare. Eddie and his friends really try tin give a good scare to Courtney using tarantulas, snakes, horrifying dogs and a lot more things but to no avail. This book explores young mind and has a very funny side and about friendship and all that stuff. The mud monster thing was totally boring. The pranks were good and the opening scenes were nice too. But its bit got the scary touch and sometimes the plot is really slow and boring but in the end I warned you not to read the book if you are easily scared. Its an easy and an average read explaining humor and monsters and their intricate relations.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Eddie Campbell is on a class field trip out in a forest with many of his classmates. Among his friends are Hat, which is the nickname of a boy who never takes off his hat; Molly and Charlene, two girls who are described as interchangeable and indeed, they are. All four of these children loathe the class show-off, Courtney King. On the field trip, Eddie is embarrassed or one-upped by Courtney several times. First she spots a deer. Then she teases Eddie for being scared of a garden snake. Then the class crowds around Courtney, as she lets two bumblebees walk across her palm. Then, she takes the bees and throws them at Eddie.<br/><br/>On the bus ride back, the quartet of friends discuss how Courtney and her best friend, Denise, never seem to be afraid of anything. As the bus drives past the muddy forest, Eddie wonders if she would even be scared of the fabled Mud Monsters that supposedly live in the forest. His older brother Kevin is making a movie about the legend of the mud monsters in his spare time, starring his friends.<br/><br/>After the field trip, Eddie begins a slow descent into obsession, eventually dragging all his friends with him as he becomes infatuated with the idea of getting Courtney back. First Eddie and his friends come up with placing a rubber snake in Courtney's lunch bag. Their schoolteacher, Mr. Melvin, forgot his lunch that day, and Courtney being the nice person she is, kindly offers to share her lunch with him. The teacher reaches into the bag and freaks out at the snake. Courtney heroically stomps on the snake until she has torn the head clear off.<br/><br/>On the way home after that failure, Eddie and his friends are approached by a neighbor lady. Her cat is stuck in a tree and she needs help rescuing it. Eddie contemplates climbing the tree, but decides he is not comfortable with the safety issues. At that moment, Courtney rides by on her bike, sees the situation, shimmies up the tree and rescues the cat for the neighbor. The neighbor then rubs it in by chastising Eddie for not being brave enough to climb the tree.<br/><br/>As they leave the neighbor, the group comes up with another plan to scare Courtney. Eddie and Hat will sneak into the school’s science lab, steal a tarantula, then race up to the rafters of the gym. Down below, Molly and Charlene will get Courtney to stand directly below the balcony, and Eddie will drop the tarantula into her hair.<br/><br/>Eddie and Hat sneak into the science lab to steal the tarantula. They place the creature into a cottage cheese container. But as soon as they close the lid, they hear the science teacher entering the lab. They both hide inside a storage locker as they hear the teacher milling about in the room. At this point Eddie notices the lid of the container is open and the tarantula is climbing up his leg. He and Hat both freak out and as soon as the teacher leaves, they discover the locker is locked. Eddie bursts out of the locker and the tarantula goes flying across the room. There is a mad dash race by Hat to capture it back into the container.<br/><br/>From the rafters, they see Courtney is finally in place below them. Hat opens the container and drops the tarantula... into Molly's hair. She freaks out and tears at her head, finally removing the spider and tossing it into the air, where it lands in Charlene's hands and she bats it about like a hot potato. Finally, Courtney calmly takes the creature in her hands and pets it, telling the bystanders that tarantulas aren't all that scary. Eddie and Hat are caught and sentenced to detention, where they are forced to write a 1,000 word essay on why ""It's wrong to steal living things and drop them on people's heads.""<br/><br/>Eddie's fiery desire to see Courtney get scared continues to eat away at him. He asks his film making brother for tips on how to scare her. He points out that a snake and a spider are too small and Eddie needs something big. Like a ferocious, angry dog.<br/><br/>Eddie runs this idea past his friends the next Saturday afternoon. Charlene suggests that Buttercup, her cuddly St. Bernard, could do the trick. The others are less than convinced and the name does nothing to help her argument. So Charlene shows them a trick that involves whistling until the dog snarls and bares its teeth and looks very menacing. When Charlene stops whistling, the dog returns to normal. Eddie is floored and wants to put the idea into motion immediately. He knows that Courtney and Denise had a tree house built near the creek and that if they were out relaxing in the forest and suddenly a wild dog attacked, they would surely be scared.<br/><br/>But how to get Courtney into the forest? Molly surprises her friends by changing her voice and pulling off a perfect impression of Denise. She will call Courtney up and pretend to be her and arrange for the two to meet at the tree house. This plan does not work so well, as when Molly calls pretending to be Denise, Denise is already standing next to Courtney.<br/><br/>A week goes by, before the weather allows for them to try to catch Courtney off-guard in the forest. The gang treks out into the forest, merely hoping that Courtney and Denise will be at their tree house, and as luck should have it, they are. Eddie takes some shaving cream out and smears it on the dog's jaw to make it look rabid. Charlene is about to whistle, when Buttercup sees a squirrel and goes running off into the thicket after the animal. The group of friends splits up to search for the dog. Eddie hears a dog growl and turns around to see a giant, pony-sized black dog with coal-burning eyes. Hat shows up and scares the giant beast away. As the four exit the clearing, they spot Courtney calmly playing with both Buttercup and the mysterious beast dog, who is licking her hand. Courtney gives them a lecture about letting their pet go wild in the forest.<br/><br/>The following week, Eddie and his friends lie to their parents and claim to be studying, but instead sit around and think of ways to scare Courtney. No decent ideas come to fruition, but on the way home, Eddie gets spooked by the wind, and gets an idea when he realizes that the reason Courtney was not getting scared was because they kept attempting to scare her during the day. They need to scare her at night.<br/><br/>At school the next day, Courtney tells her teacher that she believes in monsters. She gives proof, such as the photographs of the Loch Ness Monster and the footprints of Bigfoot. Eddie uses these comments to think up a new idea. Eddie agrees to be his older brother's slave for one month, if Kevin and his friends will dress up in their mud people costumes and scare Courtney in the forest. He agrees and Eddie tells him to go out into the forest. Now all Eddie and the gang need to figure out is how to get Courtney into the forest. Molly calls her and challenges her to meet them in the forest to see the mud monsters. Molly tells Courtney that she heard on the radio that they would be rising up from their muddy graves tonight. Courtney takes this as truth and agrees to be in the forest in ten minutes to prove she is not afraid.<br/><br/>We're then given a brief history of the legend of the mud people. Once upon a time there were two neighboring villages, one in the forest and one in the city. The city village hated the forest village and treated the villagers poorly. One stormy night, a rainstorm caused the creek in the forest to overflow and flash flood, burying the entire village in a mudslide, killing all the villagers. Local legend claims that once a year, the townspeople return to form, covered in mud, and go to find innocent victims to drag back with them into the mud.<br/><br/>The four friends hide about 100 yards behind Courtney's tree house and they see her looking out into the creek with binoculars. Suddenly, behind her, three shadowy figures emerge. Eddie's brother and friends came through; their plan worked! Eddie hears rustling behind him and the friends turn to see three more mud monsters! Eddie's brother apologizes for being late.<br/><br/>The group turns back towards the tree house and sees dozens of mud creatures emerging from the ground, all advancing on Courtney and the tree house. They scream and yell until she notices, and all of them make a mad dash run out of the forest, escaping the mud creatures. The next day at school, Courtney is given proof that she was right, monsters do exist. Eddie and his friends are still bitter about not being able to scare Courtney, and they would love to come up with another way to scare her. But the only problem is that they are too scared to try anything else.",,,1,0

A seriously old book, no doubt it was interesting enough , I read it in three hours straight (with  a lot of distractions). The story is good, the piano setting and the beginning and how the story progresses is also good. But something is very funny and weird and odd in the book. I mean its got a somewhat haunted school, a haunted piano which is associated with a warning ghost, mechanical horrifying teachers and robots, selfish parents, troublesome cats and hands that type on their own. And its surprising how these characters connect together and form a sophisticated and a reasonable plot. There could be improvements of course. I didn't like the mechanism, the hand musicians, the large robots, the entire musical school was a disaster but just on the other side the piano ghost and the cat was awesome. Its not a surprise that parents do not believe that their child saw something paranormal. (ALWAYS HAPPENS IN GOOSEBUMPS BOOK SERIES)  This time try introduce thee kid to a doctor. The ghost that our protagonist sees is trying to help him but he doesn't understand this and keeps freaking out. 30℅ of the book involves Jerry waking up, visiting the piano room and freaking out and then trying to explain his parents what he saw. It was good to involve a secondary character from the school (Girl who plays violin, though she doesn't play a major role). Overall it was a nice and quick read. It could be much better if the setting of the musical school and mechanism weren't involved and if the inventor had a strong back story. I reviewed two Goosebumps today so I'm gonna see my day off. But I'll be reading 25℅ of the next. This series is really interesting. <br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Jerry and his parents have just moved into a new house. Jerry starts out the book by forming clumps of dust into mouse-shapes and then crying that there are mice in the new house, which scares his parents. While exploring the new house, Jerry finds an old piano in the attic. Later that night, Jerry hears piano music playing from the ceiling, but when he goes to investigate, there is no one playing. The next night, he hears the music again, goes to investigate, and discovers nothing. Eventually, Jerry sees a ghost of a woman playing the piano, which has been moved down into the family room. She looks up at him and then her face melts off, revealing a bare skull. He screams hysterically for his parents.<br/><br/>Picking up on Jerry's interest in the piano, Jerry's parents enroll him in private lessons taught by Dr. Shreek. Dr. Shreek is a friendly, Santa Claus-looking old man. Dr. Shreek dwells on Jerry’s hands, constantly telling him how wonderful they are. Eventually, Jerry gets invited to take private lessons at Dr. Shreek's private school at the edge of town. When Jerry tells Kim, the Asian girl whose locker is next to his, about his lessons, she freaks out and runs away. Jerry is dropped off at the large, scary looking music school for his lesson. He immediately goes inside and sees a monster in the hall, except, it is a robotic floor sweeper that looks like a monster. Dr. Shreek tells Jerry that the maintenance man, Mr. Toggle, is a wiz at robotics.<br/><br/>Dr. Shreek then leads Jerry down the long, winding corridors to the private rehearsal room. Jerry hears piano music coming from every room in the building. As he walks down the halls, he can see the instructors hunched over the pianos, guiding unseen students. After his lesson, Jerry gets lost in the building again and Mr. Toggle comes to his rescue and leads him back to the entrance. He also promises to show Jerry his ""private workroom"", the next time he visits.<br/><br/>Jerry returns home and continues to hear the ghost playing her music. Eventually, he goes down to confront her again, and she raises her arms and reveals bloody stumps where her hands used to be. Jerry screams so hard that he passes out and when he wakes up, his parents tell him they're taking him to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist tells Jerry that he is imagining the ghost, but that he is not ""crazy."" Jerry is outside shoveling snow when he runs into Kim again. He tries to tell her about the ghost he saw, but she also thinks he is crazy. He asks why she freaked out and she tells him that she heard a lot of spooky stories about the school and that's why she ran away, because she heard some stories. Jerry decides that he does not want to take lessons again.<br/><br/>But his parents tell him that since they've already paid for his last lesson, he can go in and tell Dr. Shreek in person that he is quitting. Jerry is dropped off at the school and wastes no time in telling Dr. Shreek that he is quitting his lessons. Dr. Shreek goes berserk and insists that he needs Jerry's hands, grabbing his wrists to force him to stay. Jerry escapes his grasp and scrambles through the school building until he reaches the auditorium, where there is a crushing cacophony of piano-playing. Jerry runs inside and sees row after row of black pianos, each with a head-nodding instructor, and each piano being played by human hands, but only human hands. Dr. Shreek dives through the air and tackles Jerry, grabbing onto his ankles.<br/><br/>Mr. Toggle bursts into the room and saves Jerry, by turning off Dr. Shreek with a remote. It turns out Dr. Shreek was a robot. Jerry asks Mr. Toggle to turn off the pianos and he does that as well. Jerry thanks him for saving his life. But as he turns to leave, Mr. Toggle stops him. Mr. Toggle is the one who needs Jerry's hands, he explains. Mr. Toggle is apparently a brilliant “robotician,” but he can't make human hands correctly. So he uses human specimens and using computer technology, makes the severed hands play beautiful music all the time.<br/><br/>Jerry tries to escape the auditorium, but he runs right into the ghost girl from his house. She screams at Jerry, telling him that she tried to warn him, to scare him away from taking lessons from the school. The ghost holds up her bloody stumps and then conjures up all of the ghostly spirits from the disembodied hands playing at the pianos in the auditorium. A swarm of ghosts attached to their human hands attack Mr. Toggle in front of Jerry, carrying the robotician off into the forest behind the school, never to be seen again...<br/><br/>Months later, Jerry decides to give up on the piano ambition and signs up for the baseball team, after going to a new school and making new friends. He is not only a good batter and runner, but also a good field man. He ends the story with him saying that his friends say he has ""great hands.",,,1,0

That's what I would say. When. I grabbed this book I though I was in for a scary and paranormal adventure like Welcome to Camp Nightmare. There's nothing excellent in the book except detailed geography and descriptive nature of the Fever Marsh and that of the town and Grady and his friends including the dog. The story starts with a nice beginning but there's nothing scary in the story. Most of the time Grady and his friends take rounds at the fever swap and every time find something new and scary, each time a new discovery and new rumors. But nothing ""Paranormal"". In thought Grady's old sister would play some major role but I was disappointed when she kept showing herself on just a few days. Anyways, I didn't like the of confusing the reader into the idea of dog, wolf, werewolf, and their breeds but I gotta say that the Fever Marsh was describes very beautifully. The ending was not so scary, (Will being the werewolf and Grady changing into one after a month) the finding rabbits and deer's dead wasn't also helping. There's no back story of the hermit, the fever swamp or even of Will. I don't understand why they named the Town Fever Swamp just because everybody in the town was having fever. The parts I love were the howling of the wolves, Grady's and his  sisters journey into Fever Swamp, the howling in the night and scratching part. The Scientists View was also okay. It was annoying how the three friends would argue about wolves and werewolves. I would conclude by saying that the book is very interesting only for the first 30℅ but then it just gets very slow. Very dull and very boring.  <br/>Plot<br/><br/>The narrator, Grady Tucker and his sixteen year-old sister, Emily, have both moved to a new house with their scientist parents. Their father, Dr. Tucker, studied deer in Vermont until he came into possession of six ""Swamp Deer"" from South America. Because of this, Dr. Tucker had to move with his scientist wife and the two children to Florida so he could test his hypothesis: Deer can live in Florida. Though he keeps them in a pen in the backyard for now, Dr. Tucker intends to release the deer with tracking collars into the wild.<br/><br/>While lazing around the new backyard, Grady spots a crane with his binoculars and attempts to get Emily to accompany him into the swamp to follow the bird. The two children go exploring in the swamp. Emily learned all about forests and swamps in school, so she fills Grady in on all the scientific details.<br/><br/>Emily and Grady suddenly find themselves lost in the swamp. They wander around, eventually finding a small shack. A crazed white-haired man exits the shack and chases after the two children, who run around until finally they find the door to their house. Once inside, they tell their parents about the wild man. His father tells the children that he is just ""a swamp hermit."" Then he says that the guys at the hardware store said the swamp hermit is completely harmless.<br/><br/>Later that night, Grady is just kicking it in the backyard when another twelve year-old boy, one of his new neighbors, introduces himself as Will Blake. Will is a big child and tells Grady that the only other child their age on the block is a ""weird girl."" Will walks over to the deer pen, picks something up, and utters ""Yuck. Deer slime.""<br/><br/>Will tells a story about how Fever Swamp got named. A hundred years ago, everyone in town caught something from the swamp that started with a fever and most died and those who did not die went crazy. Late that night, Grady comes down with a fever. Woken from a fever dream, Grady hears howls coming from outside. He goes down to the kitchen to investigate and hears scratching on the exterior door. Emily wakes up too and the two siblings sit in the kitchen, listening to the howls and scratching at the door. Grady bravely opens the door but sees no one outside, and since it is midnight, does not go outside to investigate further. The two siblings listen to the sounds some more and then their father wakes up and insists on taking both of their temperatures.<br/><br/>The next morning, no sooner does Grady leave the house than he is attacked by a lovable but huge 100lb dog. The dog starts licking Grady's face and Emily comes out and pets the dog, figuring this is the source of the scratching from the previous night. After some discussion, the parents decide that a dog would be fine to let into their house.<br/><br/>Will shows up to go investigate the swamp with Grady, and suggests to the family that the dog might be part-wolf. So they name the dog, Wolf. The two boys leave the dog at the house and are not in the swamp for more than a few minutes before Wolf shows up and accompanies them into the thicket of foliage. They fool around the swamp for a while and then Wolf starts growling as he spots the Swamp Hermit. Will thinks the Swamp Hermit, whose shirt is covered in blood, might be dangerous. They remain still as the Swamp Hermit quietly leaves their line of sight.<br/><br/>As soon as the coast is clear, the boys continue exploring and come across a mauled heron. The bird has been ripped apart and there are paw prints around the body. Grady guesses a dog did it but then Will tells Grady that dogs do not rip apart birds. Will goes back home and Grady enters his house. Dr. Tucker tells Grady that the swamp is filled with scary stuff and that another bird probably killed the heron.<br/><br/>The entire family is awoken in the middle of the night by crashing from downstairs. They all huddle together and make their way down to investigate. The noise was caused by Wolf, who has run around the living room, smashing into the furniture in a desperate attempt to get out of the house. Dr. Tucker gets especially dismayed when he discovers the dog had broken the lamp. The dog starts ramming its body into the plate glass sliding door until finally the father opens the door and Wolf leaps out of the house into the swamp. The family goes back to their rooms, but before long, Grady hears howling coming from the swamp again. In the light of the full moon, Grady can make out a four-legged creature in the shadows below his window. The creature leaves something resembling a rag at the foot of the deer pen and leaves. Grady goes down to get a closer look and sees a chewed up rabbit.<br/><br/>The next morning, after breakfast, Grady takes his father to see the dead rabbit. Wolf shows up and gently licks the child's face. Emily is convinced that Wolf killed the rabbit and pleads with their father to get rid of the dog. Grady tells her she has no proof that the dog killed the bunny. Emily says there is no proof he didn't either. Will shows up and tells Grady that a neighbor, Mr. Warner, has gone missing. Apparently Mr. Warner left early the day before to go turkey hunting in the swamp and never returned. A voice from behind them suggests that a werewolf did it. That voice belongs to a redhead named Cassie O'Rourke, the weird girl Will mentioned. Will tells her to shut up, that what she is saying is stupid. Cassie presses the issue and tries to convince Grady that the howls can only be made by a werewolf that has made a fresh kill.<br/><br/>Cassie freaks out when she sees the Swamp Hermit in the distance, yells and points at him. The Swamp Hermit has a wild turkey slung over his shoulder, leading the children to wonder if he swiped it from the missing Mr. Warner. The Swamp Hermit is close enough to hear these accusations and runs out of the swamp towards the children, yelling ""I'm the werewolf! I'm the werewolf!"" over and over, cackling all the way. The other children flee, as the hermit grabs Grady's ankle, keeping him in place. The old man just cackles and waves at him with his free hand and tells Grady he was only playing. Wolf trots up and barely acknowledges the hermit, who lets Grady loose from his grip. The Swamp Hermit tells Grady to be careful about his dog and heads back to his shack. Then Grady gets bitten by a snake.<br/><br/>Wolf leads Grady back to safety and he tells Will and Cassie, who have regrouped on his lawn, to get his parents. Cassie tells Grady's mother that he was bitten by a werewolf. Grady's mother puts an ice pack on Grady's ankle and jokingly tells him that his father is a werewolf and that she shaves his back every day so he will look normal. Grady persists that a werewolf could be responsible for the events in the swamp, like the howls. The mother replies that a lot of things howl in the swamp, even Grady when he got bitten.<br/><br/>Dr. Tucker tells Grady that since the moon will only be full for two more nights, they will know after that whether or not the howls came from a werewolf. Then he too starts laughing, as he said it to mock his son. The mother picks up a newspaper and shows her black newsprint hands to Grady and tells him it is hair that's grown on her palms. Emily suggests that the dog is the werewolf.<br/><br/>Cassie and Will come over that night to eat and after dinner Grady sits with the two as they trade barbs about just who in this book is the werewolf. This quickly turns into the two just calling each other names while Grady watches. Then each accuses the other of being the werewolf.<br/><br/>Lying in bed, trying to sleep, Grady hears the howls from outside again. Then he hears a commotion below his window again. This time when he goes to investigate, he find one of the six ""swamp deer"" mauled, the other five deer huddled together in their pen, away from the gaping hole in the metal. Grady calls his father down from the lawn to see the corpse. Dr. Tucker patches the pen with a piece of cardboard.<br/><br/>After dragging the dead deer to his workshop, Dr. Tucker tells his son that clearly his dog is a killer. Grady's father tells him that tomorrow morning, he is taking the dog to the pound to be killed.<br/><br/>The next morning, Grady's father tries to take Wolf to the pound but Grady tells his dog to run away and it does. Grady's father tells him that was dumb, because the dog is bound to come back, and when it does, he is going to take it to be killed.<br/><br/>Wolf manages to stay out of sight all day and it isn't until late that night that Grady spots him from his bedroom window, lingering at the swamp clearing. Grady goes down to greet his dog and runs into Will. Will claims to have heard the howls and was trying to investigate, when he ran into Grady. The two boys spot Wolf, who has edged back into the swamp. Grady runs after him, losing Will in the process. Following his dog, Grady ends up at the Swamp Hermit's hut. He hears the horrible howling coming from near the shack and he believes that the hermit was the werewolf.<br/><br/>Soon, Grady finds out that Will is the Werewolf, the hard way. He gets bitten in the shoulder by him. Luckily, Wolf comes and fights off Will saving Grady's life. But Grady eventually passes out.<br/><br/>When he comes to, he finds himself safely inside his own home.

It is chilling indeed and I was enthusiastic to read ""Welcome to Camp Nightmare"" cause I've been to a handful if camps while I was younger and its a lot of fun. Err. Not for young Billy, it seems. The Camp Nightmoon (Aka Nightmare) is truly horrifying for young kids and especially the counselors and Uncle Al. The forbidden Room, the Sabre attack, Rogers death, Larry's personality, The girls Camp. Especially Dawn and Dori, The events at the camp she unbelievable conclusion to the story are the things that I like about the book. The book ends with a not-so-horrifying conclusion and one thing (A big bug) is that Roger is really dead and theres no explanation about the Sabre attack that Roger died in.(If you are reading the review without reading the book you who understand this). I really thought that the Camp administrators were some kind of dead ghosts like in Goosebumps Book #1 but my hopes were dashed. This book is a bit boing at the beginning. But it progresses fast and the story grasps the reader and pulls him in. Great book with nice and scary story and probably this will be the only book which may receive a 4/5. <br/>Plot<br/>Billy Harlan has just been sent off to Camp Nightmoon by his parents, who are explorers and scientists. While on the bus to camp, Billy encounters many characters, such as Mike, the fat child who is scared of everything; Colin, who wears sunglasses and a red bandanna around his long brown hair; Jay, the jockish child with wild curly red hair and Dawn and Dori, two girls from the Girl Camp fraction of Camp Nightmoon. The bus driver stops the vehicle in the middle of a desert on the way to the camp and orders everyone out of the bus. He unpacks everyone's belongings and drives off, abandoning the children in the desert. The children are suddenly surrounded by a group of creatures who prepare to slaughter the children, until a man shows up on another bus with a rifle and shoots it at the creatures. The creatures run away in fear.<br/><br/>The man who saved the children introduces himself as the leader of Camp Nightmoon, Uncle Al. Uncle Al invites the children onto his bus and drives approximately five minutes to the camp from where they were dropped off.<br/><br/>Mike and Jay and Colin all bunk together. While preparing their cabin, Mike finds a pair of poisonous snakes in his bed. Jay jokes around and play pushes Mike into the snakes. But Mike gets bitten on his hand, which then starts copiously bleeding. He runs off to find the nurse, while Billy devises a plan to rid the snakes by wrapping them up in a bed sheet and throwing them outside. This plan is heralded as brave by their bunk's counselor, Larry, who then laughs when he is told that Mike went to find the nurse because there is no nurse. Mike returns and as his hand is described as bleeding profusely onto the floor of the cabin, Larry tells him to just wash his hand and wrap a bandage around it. The boys go to eat dinner around a campfire, where Uncle Al tells them the rules of Camp Nightmoon. The campers have to write home every day to tell their parents what fun they're having. They are not allowed out in the forest or along the river that runs between the boy's and girl's camps. This is peppered with a warning by Uncle Al that the forest is dangerous and infested with Tree Bears.<br/><br/>Uncle Al also informs the campers that they are not allowed to ever enter the Forbidden Bunk. Jay decides after the fire that he wants to sneak out to see the Forbidden Bunk. Larry overhears him and tells him he probably should not, as the Forbidden Bunk is where theSabre lurks. Then the boys hear hideous howling from the Forbidden Bunk. The next day, the bunkmates are all enlisted to play something called Scratchball. This entails one person throwing a ball as far as they can, then attempting to run all four bases of a baseball diamond before someone catches it. Mike sits this game of Scratchball out, as his hand is swollen. Larry plays his spot and after Colin makes a move he does not appreciate, Larry loses his temper and throws the ball directly at the back of Colin's head. Colin is knocked to the ground and Larry helps both Mike and Colin to the main cabin to see Uncle Al.<br/><br/>Billy and Jay go back to the bunk and work on writing their daily letters home. Larry enters with Colin, who is miraculously just a little sore. Billy asks where Mike is but Larry just shrugs and leaves. Later, Billy discovers all of Mike's belongings removed from the cabin, and no one will tell him where Mike went.<br/><br/>Later that night, Jay introduces Billy and Colin to some child named Roger when a plan is devised for the two to sneak into the Forbidden Bunk. Billy and Colin decline the invitation to sneak out and Jay and Roger leave for a short time.  Then there are screams and Jay runs back and tells Billy that Roger was attacked and mauled by the Sabre. The three boys lock themselves in the cabin, until morning.<br/><br/>When they do leave, they do not see any traces of the previous night's atrocities. They find Larry and tell him what happened to Roger. Larry seems a little confused but agrees to talk to Uncle Al about the missing camper.  Billy goes down with some campers to the river for a swim, where he is met by Larry, who tells him that Uncle Al searched the Forbidden Bunk but could not find any traces of foul play, and what's worse, Uncle Al has no record of there ever being a camper named Roger at Camp Nightmoon.<br/><br/>At the river, Billy is accosted by Dawn and Dori, who have swam over from the girl's camp and hid in the bushes for hours on the hopes that Billy would walk by. The girls tell Billy that campers are disappearing from their camp as well, and they plan on making a break for it very soon. The three agree to meet again and Billy takes off back towards the bunk. On the way, he spots a payphone by Uncle Al's offices. He plans to call home to his parents and pleads for them to come to the camp and rescue him and all his friends. Unfortunately, the telephone turns out to be a plastic decoy. Uncle Al walks out of the bunk and informs Billy that campers are not allowed to use the telephone. And also Billy's going on a canoe trip tomorrow.<br/><br/>When Billy makes it back to the bunk, he tells Jay and Colin about the girls. Then the three of them decide to write to their parents and tell them precisely what is happening and hope for a speedy rescue. Larry stomps into the cabin and tells Colin and Jay that they are going on a special two camper hike with a counselor named Frank. The two campers and the counselor all mysteriously disappear with no explanation. After trying and failing to get answers out of Larry, Billy stumbles into Uncle Al's office. There, he finds a burlap sack full of all the letters he and his fellow campers had been writing, which have clearly never been mailed at all.<br/><br/>When Billy returns to his bunk after dinner, he meets his two new bunkmates, Tommy and Chris, who will also be joining Billy on his canoe trip tomorrow. Tommy and Chris also tell Billy that Uncle Al announced that Visitor's Day has been canceled, so no one's parents will be arriving anytime soon.<br/><br/>The next morning, Larry takes Billy, Chris, and Tommy out to the canoe and the four head off downstream. Larry decides he would like to look at the fish in the river. Unfortunately, he leans too far out of the canoe and falls in.<br/><br/>Billy bravely abandons his two bunkmates in the canoe and leaves them to float downstream, while he rescues the drowning counselor. Billy pulls Larry to safety and the two walk up the bank of the river back to camp. Larry tells Uncle Al that Billy saved his life. Billy keeps trying to get either Uncle Al or Larry to acknowledge that the two bunkmates were in the canoe, but Uncle Al finally pays attention and scolds Larry on losing his favorite canoe.<br/><br/>The next day, Billy is awoken early by Larry. Apparently, Uncle Al has called a surprise morning hike and the whole camp is required to attend. Billy and what's left of his campmates are walking in the forest when Uncle Al instructs his counselors to remove rifles from their bags and pass them out to the children. Two girls have escaped from the girl's camp, Uncle Al informs the campers, and Billy is excited that Dawn and Dori made it out. Uncle Al then instructs the children that they are to find the two girls, who are presumed to be hiding in the forest, and shoot them. Billy refuses this order and instead turns his gun on Uncle Al and fires.<br/><br/>The gun does not go off and Uncle Al gets very excited and declares ""You've passed the test!""  Dawn and Dori appear from within the forest. So does Jay and Colin and everyone else Billy had met at the camp. Then his parents show up and give him a big congratulatory hug. Billy is told that his parents wanted him to go with them on their next big exploration. But first he needed to be tested by the government to see if he was ready. Uncle Al tells Billy that he passed the test by Obeying Orders (not going into the Forbidden Cabin), Showing Bravery (rescuing Larry from drowning), and Knowing When Not To Follow Orders (refusing to shoot the girls). Billy is told about the strange place they're going to be exploring.

I wouldn't necessarily call her a scaredy cat. Everybody, even her friends are trying to scare her and she is easily scared, so I bet that she would have a hectic lifestyle, unsure and nervous. What could be better than to scare and venue herself a hundred times over and hundred times as scary. The book from the Goosebumps collection introduces us readers to another living abiotic organism namely, the Haunted make just like the Living Dummy. This is the Living and Horrifying face changing mask. The character of Carly Beth is sure interesting. Her friends too. I liked the Science Project, Halloween Event, Purchasing masks, Possession, and the horrifying end. (For Noah. Carly Beth's Brother.) I was surprised that Stine did not mention a back story or a sad story of the mask(s) in the shop that the shopkeeper sells. Even though there's a reason for the masks to cone alive (As explained to Carly by to Shopkeeper) its not very believable and not interesting. The way, the mask possesses Carly seems very real and life size. I would surely recommend the book to young reader and you would cherish it as a quick Halloween Night Read. (There's a big Halloween Festival that is just great in the book. That when the fun begins. By fun I mean possession and mischievousness.<br/>Plot<br/><br/>Carly Beth Caldwell is sitting talking about her trick or treating costume with her talkative best friend, Sabrina Mason. Carly Beth is a quiet, shy, and overly trusting girl. She is easily scared of almost everything, and repeatedly humiliated by her friends, Chuck Greene and Steve Boswell, at school who call her a ""scaredy cat"", and delight in making her life a misery. After being tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich that contained a live worm, Carly Beth flees home in shame and vows revenge.<br/><br/>At home, Carly Beth discovers her mother, Kate, has made a perfect likeness of Carly Beth's face from plaster of Paris as a symbol of her love for her. Carly Beth is also annoyed to discover her mother has made her a silly duck costume. Carly Beth goes to her bedroom, where her little brother, Noah, has dressed up in her costume and frightens her. After Carly Beth sends Noah away, she calls Sabrina on the telephone. They talk about the cruel prank Steve played on her and Carly Beth swears she will never fall for one of their stunts again. Then she muses about buying a horrible mask from a new shop that has just opened.<br/><br/>The day before Halloween at a science fair, Carly Beth is once again made a fool of after Steve pretends his tarantula has escaped, knowing full well Carly Beth is terrified of spiders. Steve sneaks up behind Carly Beth and pinches her leg, making it seem as though the tarantula is biting her. Carly Beth runs off in tears, after everyone laughs at her. On Halloween day, she collects her money and sets off for the costume shop, distraught that it is closed. However the mysterious owner of the shop allows her entry and she unwillingly stumbles upon a back room filled with the most hideous, deformed masks she has ever seen. The owner refuses to sell her the one she wants. But she is insistent and takes off with the mask while throwing the money to him. Thrilled, she goes home, puts on the mask, and scares her brother. However the mask will not come off at first, when it finally does, Carly Beth and Noah are unsure as to how she unintentionally changed her voice to a hoarse growl. Carly Beth simply remarks, ""I don't know... but I like it"".<br/><br/>She then makes her way to the front door, stares at the mirror for a second or two, hesitating to put the mask back on, but she does anyways. While putting on the mask for a second time, the mask seems to warp or ""suck"" it's self onto Carly Beth's face. Dismissing the transformation as normal, Carly Beth steals the Plaster of Paris mold of her head that her mother made, and goes in search of Chuck and Steve, determined to make them pay. Yet strange things start happen to her. She acts like a totally different person: she attacks Sabrina, frightens young children, vandalizes the neighborhood.<br/><br/>After finding Chuck and Steve and scaring them however, Carly Beth is horrified to notice that the mold of her face spoke, imploring Steve and Chuck to ""help"" her. Steve and Chuck run off in fear and Carly Beth gleefully abandons the plaster face. Back at Sabrina's house, Carly Beth tries but cannot remove the mask. Sabrina tugs and pulls at Carly Beth's sweaty mask, but it does not seem to give. To her horror, Sabrina discovers that there is no space between the mask and her skin. The mask has somehow fused itself to Carly Beth's own face. Rather than seeing her own normal eyes staring back at her in the mirror, Carly Beth sees evil, animal-like, orange eyes leering back at her. Sobbing, she returns to the shop where she bought the mask and finds the owner waiting for her, knowing she would come back.<br/><br/>Despite her desperate pleas, the shopkeeper tells Carly Beth over and over that the mask cannot be removed as it is not simply a mask...it is a real, living face. He tells her that he created them and they were once beautiful, but they slowly decayed over time and became hideous, repulsive monsters. He refers to them as ""The Unloved Ones"". It turns out every so often a young, innocent person like Carly Beth, finds one thinking it to only be a latex mask, puts it on and the mask begins to become one with the victims skin as the mask fuses with them and begins to slowly take over their mind. The shopkeeper says, ""The only way to remove the mask is to find a 'symbol of love'. But if the mask is ever put on a third time, it will be forever."" As she looks into the mirror and sees the hideous, grotesque face staring back at her, Carly Beth begins to cry out and scream in horror, realizing that she might possibly never see her true, young face ever again.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Carly Beth's hysterical screams and shrieks begin to slowly awaken the evil masks who before laid dormant, lying in wait for their next victims to consume. They begin floating off of their model heads and start to slowly, but surely, fly at Carly Beth. They pursue her down the street and Carly Beth finally realizes that the mold her mother gave her is a symbol of love she needs to remove the mask from her body. Carly Beth uses it to deter the masks and remove the monstrous face that has attached itself to her. She then returns home to her mother. Once she gets home, she drops the mask by the door and runs for her mother's warm embrace, Noah then appears from the other room to reveal he has apparently put on the mask, and he can not get it off!",,,1,0

Reading this book really redefines and illustrates what the phrase means and what potential dangers lie ahead if people who mess with nature and sometimes how nature (Clarisse) messes with them. The story is great and not very horrifying or scary. It's just very unreal but is written in a very well way which makes you believe as if you are reading a true teenager girls story. Samantha is truly a klutz. There is no doubt. The first wish was really dull. Sam (Short for Samantha) could really increase her imagination, she could really wish for something bug and not something tribal such as being the best in basketball. Bit I don't blame her, she made the with believing that Clarissa is an old woman. She didn't care. By the way, the character of Clarisse is really amazing, her costume, speech and all. The second wish was okay, but things went bad not because Sam but because Clarisse could not actually fulfill the wish as specified. It was totally nice to see the whole world vanish in a day. The third was great!!! I don't know why Sam got so tired of Jenith.  That was really bad. I would gibe it one more star if Stine had a back story for Clarisse and having her own particular story and place of work. I like the beginning, the end, meeting Clarissa, the second and to third wish, and all the fighting and troublesome tines for Sam. A completely different and enchanting book from goosebumps series but it can have a few improvements.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Samantha ""Fly Away"" Byrd is an unnaturally tall and constantly clumsy twelve-year-old girl. She repeatedly makes a fool of herself on the basketball team at school and is always making mistakes and getting into accidents. Thus, she is constantly being harassed by the popular girls in her school, Judith Bellwood and Anna Frost. Samantha stays after school to practice for the basketball team.<br/><br/>One rainy afternoon after practice, Samantha happens to come upon an old woman named Clarissa who can't find her way home. Samantha helps the old woman and is rewarded with three wishes. Samantha is skeptical, but decides to humor Clarissa by wishing that she were the strongest basketball player on her school team. The next day, during a basketball game, Samantha remains clumsy and untalented. But somehow all the other girls, including Judith and Anna, lose their strength and fall mysteriously ill. Samantha realizes this is her wish come true, though not as she had wanted. She would have rather become a stronger, faster player. All that has happened is that the other players are weaker. Samantha visits Judith, who is delirious with the sickness and accuses Samantha of witchcraft. Samantha gets angry and inadvertently makes her second wish: that Judith would just disappear.<br/><br/>When Samantha wakes up the next morning, she finds that she is the only person left in supposedly the entire world. There is no one at home or school or on the street. After some aimless wandering, Samantha meets up with Clarissa. Clarissa apologizes for the wish, stating that she is not skilled in magic and could not make Judith disappear without making everyone else disappear. Clarissa offers to cancel the second wish and give Samantha a third wish... if Samantha can make a clear wish. Samantha wishes that everything is back to the way it was, except that Judith becomes Samantha's friend.<br/><br/>This wish is then granted and Judith does indeed become Samantha's friend. But Samantha soon finds that Judith has become pathologically obsessed with Samantha - dressing like her, wearing her hair like her, pleading to wait on her, and constantly praising her. Samantha tries to get away from Judith and ends up crashing her bike in front of Clarissa. Clarissa, feeling sorry that Samantha is not happy with her final wish, grants Samantha a fourth wish. Samantha wishes that she never met Clarissa and that Judith was the one who met Clarissa instead. The wish is granted and Judith becomes Clarissa's friend. As Samantha walks away, she overhears Judith yelling, ""Fly away, Byrd!"" and Samantha, now a black crow, does just that and begins her new life away from being bullied and harassed.",,,1,0

The story is new, takes turns, sad(in the end), comforting to read, easy and interesting as it progresses. The Fairchild family is nice too. Especially the twins. My hopes were dashed when I understood they are dead. The plot has been planned very nicely. There are some niche(Empty Spaces) in the bloom Whig do not exactly clarify something. The shadow is a mysterious person who is revealed to be Danny's Ghost. (How can a person who's alive have a ghost personality at the same time, I guess its like the alternate personality in Let's get Invisible, who wants to murder his real personality to get into the real world. Another thing is how Hannah doesn't understand for five years (Time seems difficult to understand I ghosts life) that she is a ghost. Even her family, when disappears don't tell her about it. This is not the usual ghost story that you read. It is completely different and mesmerising. Hanna's realization that she is a ghost is the turning point of the story. The Falls Town, The shops, the residents, the PostKeeper are also secondary characters that are somewhat important. I really didn't like the shadow thing. This is a unique and rich novel from the goosebumps series that will leave you thinking. Nice Reading",,,1,0

There, the Mister Dad ate plant food. Here, the librarian eats worms and Fleas(Yuck!) Most of the book has rides from Home to the Library spying the librarian and watching him turn into a monster and being back again and then trying to convince her parents and friend what she (Lucy) saw. The story progresses not much at the beginning, but at the end you won't believe how fast it goes. The characters and plotlines are predictable (Not at the end) and you can easily suspect the plotline and what's gonna happen next. The librarian Aka the Monsters is not at all scary, with his fat and bulgy body I'd rather saw him as a funny little guy who loves book and can never harm anyone. (Except some fleas and worms maybe). Lucy really seems to like monsters at the beginning but we don't hear her monster stories (False ones) after 20℅ of the Book. Its a epitome of the lesson ""The girl who cried wolf""(Or was it boy) ? Anyways, its not that enjoyable but okay for small children who have just begun reading some horror.(I don't think this will give them chills.)<br/>I'll give what it deserves 2/5<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Lucy ""Lucille"" Dark is spending her summer vacation scaring her younger brother and participating in the local library's reading program. She scares her brother, Randy ""Randall"" Dark, by merely mentioning that there might be a monster behind a tree, in a bush, around the corner, etc. Randy falls for this because he is six years old. The reading program at the library is called Reading Rangers and the deputy of this program is the hideous, bald, sweaty mole-like man named Mr. Mortman.<br/><br/>Mr. Mortman tries to encourage Lucy to read the classics, but the only book she really digs is Mary Shelley'sFrankenstein. She asks whether White Fang is about a monster and she also asks if Anne of Green Gables has any monsters in it.<br/><br/>One rainy summer evening, Lucy leaves the library and realizes she forgot her roller blades. She goes back to the library after it has closed and while hiding sees Mr. Mortman reaching into his desk to procure some flies to feed to his pet turtles, which he keeps in a metal pan on his desk at all times. Lucy sees Mr. Mortman's head swell up, his eyes bulge out, and his mouth turn into a gaping black maw. Lucy leaves in a hurry and forgets her roller blades again and so she heads back to get her roller blades, but then the door is locked.<br/><br/>She tries to tell everyone who will listen about how Mr. Mortman is a monster. But they do not listen to her because she is always talking about monsters. So a week later, she returns to the library and after Mr. Mortman gives her a new book for the reading club, she hides in the stacks to catch Mr. Mortman in the act. After he escorts everyone out of the building, Mr. Mortman locks the door.<br/><br/>Lucy says to herself, ""This is boring."" Then Mr. Mortman turns into a monster again! Then he eats some flies again. Then he picks up a turtle, chews up the shell, and swallows it.<br/><br/>Lucy runs to the locked door and realizes the door is locked from the inside. She makes it out of the library again. She runs home and sees her friend named Aaron, who she then tries to convince that she saw a monster. He does not believe her at all. She goes into her house and tries to convince Randy about Mr. Mortman, but he also does not believe her.<br/><br/>There is a knock on the door. It is Mr. Mortman. He kindly returns Lucy's bookbag, which she had left in the library. He asks if she had stayed behind after he closed up, but she says no. He bids her farewell, as her mother pulls up in the driveway.<br/><br/>Her parents will not listen to her, so she enlists Aaron's help. Lucy offers him five dollars in advance to accompany her to the library. Her newest plan involves her and Aaron going back to the library. They hide, he sees Mr. Mortman turn into a monster, and then they plan to both tell her parents. Unfortunately, on the day of the big plan execution, Aaron is nowhere to be found and seen. So Lucy decides she will go back to the library again.<br/><br/>Lucy again hides in the library, alone, waiting for Mr. Mortman to change into a monster. Except this time, she has brought a camera to snap his picture. Once Mr. Mortman transforms into a monster again, Lucy takes his picture, but forgets about the flash and Mr. Mortman flies into a rage. There is a chase scene and Lucy escapes the library one more time. That night, Lucy's family all goes to the mall to eat at the Chinese restaurant. Lucy pleads with her father to get her roll of film developed so she can prove to him once and for all that Mr. Mortman is a monster. After dinner, Lucy races to the one hour photo joint to pick up her picture of Mr. Mortman. Except the photograph shows an empty desk in the library, Mr. Mortman did not show up in the picture at all.<br/><br/>Never deterred, Lucy has to come up with a new plan. It still involves hiding and spying, this time her and Aaron are scouting out Mr. Mortman's home rather than the library. The two children tail Mr. Mortman from the library to his house. Lucy peeks through the living room window, just in time to see Mr. Mortman indulge in a series of grotesque meals. First he takes a big handful of fish from his aquarium and shoves them into his mouth. Then Mr. Mortman chews up an entire snail, shell, and all. Following that, he slurps up an entire eel-like a spaghetti strand. Lucy tries to get Aaron to come peek in the window, but he is off looking for a ladder to see into Mr. Mortman's house better.<br/><br/>Lucy loses her balance and falls from the window. Aaron runs away from the house, as Mr. Mortman exits the house and picks her up off the ground. Lucy makes up a story about how she was just there to tell him she would not be at the Reading Rangers meeting the next day. He offers to let her inside so she can call her parents for a ride home, but she does not want to go inside.<br/><br/>Lucy's parents will not let her quit Reading Rangers. Forced to attend her meeting with Mr. Mortman, Lucy braves the rain and returns to the library. Before he starts the meeting, Mr. Mortman gets up and locks the door. He tells her he can't let her leave. He starts to make his move towards her when she leaps up and attempts to escape. It seems dire but then she comes up with the bright idea of tearing out a drawer of the card catalog, spilling the contents on the ground. Mr. Mortman, though still a monster, is also a librarian and he stops his pursuit of Lucy to organize the cards. Lucy runs out into freedom. She also runs out into Aaron, who had been hiding in the library. Turns out he saw Mr. Mortman turn into a monster and is willing to tell her parents.<br/><br/>Lucy and Aaron tell Lucy's parents about Mr. Mortman and they respond with, ""Well, I guess we have to invite him to dinner."" A few nights later, Mr. Mortman shows up for dinner. The family makes polite small talk with the librarian, who eventually inquires as to what is for dinner and asks the father to repeat himself. The father says ""You are!"" again and he starts getting scared then Lucy's parents, who are monsters themselves. Lucy's parents then eat Mr. Mortman alive (off-screen), as their children cheer with joy, which they turn out to be monsters themselves.",,,1,0

That demon Dummy. I totally knew that this was going to be a hit. I had read the Welcome to Horrorland #1 featuring Slappy and the two twin sisters. These two twin sisters are a riot. They are incredible, funny, easily scared, and pranky. Its horrible how they play trims on each other and its an epitome of sibling rivalry. Even the two dummies, Mr.Wood and Slappy are incredible. Unlike the other goosebumps books, leaving a few, this book grows interesting as it moves forward. It though Slappy would be the villain, but it was Mr.Wood, no problem. Mr.Wood is satisfactory, excellent rather. His grins, talks, blinks, and his horrible language. The ventriloquist act is also nice, but I don't find it very funny. The first half of the book makes you believe that Slappy is the villain but its just a prank. Mr.Wood has a unique and quite horrific personality. Parents and elders just drop dead. They just never believe their kids. The auditorium Act, Awakening Mr.Wood, the conclusion, Kitchen pranks, Closet prank, Neighbour pranks are quite interesting and sometimes funny. <br/>""I'm warning you, I got powers"" was the feature dialogue of Mr.Wood. The appearance both the dummies is also figured up greatly.

It is revealed that the neighborhood children love ventriloquism. Lindy is soon being offered $20 to perform at birthday parties and Kris begins to ask her parents for a dummy of her own. Her parents propose the two girls could share Slappy. When Kris attempts to retrieve the toy from Lindy, Slappy tells her that she is a moron and then slaps her across the face.<br/><br/>The next day, Mr. Powell brings home another ventriloquist dummy that he bought at a pawn shop. Kris names him Mr. Wood. Then she begins bragging to Lindy that her toy has better clothes than Slappy.<br/><br/>Lindy comes back every day with more stories of how good she is at ventriloquism. Lindy also reveals that besides just telling jokes, she and Slappy have a ""rap routine"".<br/><br/>A couple days later, Lindy volunteers to help Kris with her ventriloquism, as Kris has been told by the music teacher that she can perform at the school concert. While helping her, Mr. Wood turns his violent rage towards Kris again and begins calling her terrible names. Kris hops over to pull the dummy away from Lindy but Lindy insists she hasn't done anything; the toy is alive.<br/><br/>Later that night, the sisters walk in on Mr. Wood strangling Slappy. The two girls agree to talk to their mother about the strange occurrences. They walk in on her reading a Stephen Kingbook. Their mother tells them to shut up about the dummies and go to bed.<br/><br/>Later that night, Kris finds Mr. Wood in the kitchen, surrounded by a pile of food from the fridge and also her jewelry. Lindy comes down and sees Kris frozen in shock at the sight and before they can clean it all up, Mrs. Powell comes downstairs. Already grouchy since Mr. Powell is away on business in Portland, she threatens to take away both their dummies if they do not quit pretending that one of their dummies are evil. The two girls talk her out of such punishment by promising to clean everything up. Back upstairs, Lindy diabolically admits she was responsible for all of Mr. Wood's bad behavior.<br/><br/>The next day, Kris finds a piece of paper in the Mr. Wood's pocket. She recites the strange foreign words printed on the slip of paper (Karru Marri Odonna Loma Molanu Karrano- you and I are one now) and is astonished to see the dummy blink, even though her hand was nowhere near the blinking mechanism. How is that possible?<br/><br/>That night, Mr. and Mrs. Miller stop by for a visit. The parents volunteer their children to perform for the elderly guests. Kris foolishly suggests Lindy go first and naturally Lindy kills. Kris copes and still figures this will be good practice for her appearance at the concert the next day. Before she can begin her act though, Mr. Wood begins brutally harassing the old couple. Mr. Wood asks, if Mr. Miller is growing a mustache or if he is simply eating a rat. Kris runs away crying and her parents ground her, but still allow her to perform at the concert.<br/><br/>The following day, Mrs. Berman leads Kris up to the stage. While the overweight woman adjusts the microphone, Mr. Wood lets fly some real humdingers about her weight. Appalled that a child's dummy would have such a foul attitude, the rotund teacher demands an apology. Mr. Wood replies by puking green vomit at her. Then he turns his open mouth out into the audience, soaking the children in vomit. Mrs. Berman tells Kris she is suspended from school and, if she has it her way, possibly expelled.<br/><br/>Back at home, Mr. Powell tells Kris that Mr. Wood is going back to the pawnshop on Monday. He tosses the toy in the closet and sternly warns Kris against playing with the horrible vomiting ventriloquist dummy that she hates.<br/><br/>Kris tries to drift off to sleep, but is awoken by the unmistakable sound of wooden feet walking across a carpeted floor. She is startled to find Mr. Wood has come out of the closet. She is even more shocked, when he tells her without a lisp that her and her sister are his slaves. Kris pounces on the dummy and the toy responds by punching her in the stomach.<br/><br/>Wounded, Kris drops the toy and it starts scampering away into the hall. Kris catches up at the top of the stairs and throws herself over the toy. Lindy walks out into the hall and understandably has more than a few questions. Kris attempts to get up to explain and Mr. Wood slips out from underneath her and starts making his way down the stairs like a snake. Kris runs down to catch up with him and pins him beneath her foot, just as their parents arrive to ask what is going on. Kris and Lindy try to explain but their parents ground Lindy, believing that she helped Kris with the concert incident, begin to question Kris' mental well-being, and suggest maybe she should see a doctor.<br/><br/>As soon as their befuddled parents disappear back upstairs, the toy comes back to life and tells the girls that they are still his slaves. Lindy and Kris respond by trying to decapitate him, first by pulling off his head, then by twisting it off, and finally by just hacking at it with a pair of scissors. None of these tactics work and Mr. Wood just calmly reminds them that they are his slaves.<br/><br/>Mr. Wood soon finds himself stuffed into a suitcase by the two girls and buried underneath the loose soil of the construction site next door. After digging all night, the two girls collapse into their beds and drift off to sleep.<br/><br/>Kris wakes up early and makes her way downstairs, only to find Mr. Wood waiting for her. She calls her family, but her parents continue to disbelieve her and leave the house to go to the store.  Kris pleads with her father to bring the dummy back to the pawn shop today, but Mr. Powell says no.<br/><br/>Mr. Wood tells the two girls that someone is going to have to die to show he is serious and then starts choking Barky, the family dog. The girls try pulling the evil dummy off the dog, but only end up dragging Mr. Wood and the dying dog across the kitchen tile. Mr. Wood finally loosens its grasp on Barky and the two girls run outside and toss Mr. Wood in the path of a steamroller. Right before Mr. Wood's about to be hit, Barky runs into the path of the steamroller and the two girls are forced to let go of Mr. Wood to rescue the dog. Mr. Wood escapes and begins taunting the girls, a taunt that is interrupted by another steamroller which slams into him from behind. A mysterious green gas rises from the smashed corpse of the toy.<br/><br/>The driver running out of the steamroller starts panicking, because he thinks he has run over a child. Then the girls start explaining that he only ran over a ventriloquist dummy. The twin sisters tell him that he can keep the toy's smashed corpse and they walk back home.<br/><br/>Once the girls arrive back home, Slappy says to Kris, who is going to shut the open window, ""Hey, slave - is that other guy gone? I thought he'd never leave!"" and then he screeched with a evil laugh.",,,1,0

Always, I notice that R.L Stine finds children and horror/thriller find each other in each of his book. Well, the plot focuses on 5 children, one of them extremely annoying and the others playful and sometimes worrying. Its not that much greater because most of it is vanishing and coming back. About 70 pages are wasted in this foolish act. And when someone goes invisible they try to scare the characters about it, and they end up succeeding. This happens about 10 times which makes the "" Now you are here, No you are not"" thing very boring!!! The beginning of the book was extremely powerful with all sort of fun for the children, but later its all about getting invisible and getting visible and about the silly invisibility competition that Max and his friends hold. The end was scaring and unsuspecting...And yes....It gave me goosebumps but just for a moment or two.<br/><br/><br/>Plot<br/>This story begins when Max Thompson, a twelve-year-old boy, is combing his hair for his birthday party. Unfortunately, his younger brother, Noah (called Lefty, because he is left-handed), always teases him around.<br/><br/>Max's best friend, Zack, shows up armed with a weird haircut and a lousy present (some used X-Forcecomics). Also at the party are two girls: Erin, whose voice sounds like a mouse, and April, a shy girl. Max excitedly tells his guests that they are ""barbecuing""-up some hot dogs. Max tries to get everyone to watch ""the Terminator movie"" he rented.<br/><br/>The party dies down and only April and Erin are left. The four children decide to explore a dusty old attic. Max's dog, Whitey, discovers a hidden room in the attic. The room is empty, except for a large antique mirror that takes up almost the entire wall. A slender light rests on top of the mirror and when Max pulls the light's chain, the light comes on but he disappears.<br/><br/>After turning the light off, Max reappears. Max does not believe he really turned invisible, even though the other children insisted that he did. Erin and April's ride arrives and Max tries to put the whole ordeal behind him. Yet that night, he has trouble sleeping and sneaks up to the attic to investigate. Max slowly takes an inventory of the mirror's construction, when he spies an ominous figure behind him. He turns to discover it is only Lefty.<br/><br/>Lefty whines, until Max agrees that he can go invisible only if they both go invisible at the same time. They both go invisible for a couple minutes, start to feel weak, and then pull the switch again. This time, however, it takes longer to reappear. Max figures that it must have something to do with how they were invisible longer than Max was the first time.<br/><br/>The two brothers decide the best way to use this amazing new power of invisibility is to scare Zack, who was not there for the prior mirrorfest. And eventually, they get him over to the house and they do scare him.Then they invisible him. Then April and Erin show up. Erin also wants to get invisible, but April remains hesitant and instead times everyone's excursions into invisibility. The children will all attempt to stay invisible the longest. Before Lefty can take his turn though, his grandparents arrive for dinner and the other children have to leave. But they agree to meet again later in the week to settle the contest.<br/><br/>While at dinner, Max sees a spoon rises in the air. Max wrestles with the invisible Lefty and drags him upstairs to the attic. Lefty brags as he comes back into sight, that he stayed invisible for over ten minutes, so now he holds the record. Lefty promises not to use the mirror again.<br/><br/>That night, Max stays up late because of the weekend and hopes that his parents will let him stay up and watchSaturday Night Live. Erin calls and tries to convince Max that if they brought the mirror to school for the science fair, they would be sure to get first prize and appear in People. Max tells her that it is a bad idea, because the wrong people could find out about the mirror, like the military.<br/><br/>Max sneaks off to the attic. He sits against the wall opposite the mirror and stares at his reflection. As he starts to doze off, he is startled to hear a voice in the mirror, asking him to change his ways. Max runs down to his bedroom and hides underneath the sheets, until morning.<br/><br/>When Max awakens, he soon discovers that Lefty is invisible again. But this time, he is using invisibility to float a shirt in Max's room. Max makes his brother go upstairs and change. When he comes back down, Max and his mother notice he is acting a little strange and there is something not quite right about him.<br/><br/>Max tells Lefty that he has decided getting invisible is too dangerous and calls his friends to cancel the invisibility championship. However, when the day of the championship arrives, Zack and the two girls show up at Max's house anyways. It turns out Lefty, who is currently hanging out at the park with his friends, called them up and uncancelled the championship. Max decides that as long as they are all there, they might as well go up to the attic.<br/><br/>April finally gets to disappear, but since Max's dog accidentally gets invisible with her, he brings her back early. She is upset, but is again relegated to taking the time for the others. Erin goes next and for the first twelve minutes or so she is up to her regular hovering objects shenanigans. However, for several minutes they can't get her to respond to their questions. Eventually they spy a floating Coke can and Max brings her back by turning on the light. After she comes back into focus, she claims she just got thirsty and went downstairs and that is why she didn't reply. However, Max notices something odd about her appearance too.<br/><br/>Zack decides he is going to smother the record and does not want to be pulled back into reality, until after fifteen minutes have passed. He then takes off outside and pulls a hilarious prank on an older neighbor. He picks up tomatoes and he makes them hover in the air. Once his friends stop laughing at his riotous object floating, they notice that he too does not reply to their calls. Against Erin's objections, Max races upstairs and turns the light off.<br/><br/>Zack reappears and Max can't help but notice that his haircut has now been reversed. Max tries to say something, but Erin and Zack push him under the light of the mirror and turn it on. He decides to not go anywhere and simply wait out his turn. As the time presses on, he begins to feel weaker and a white haze begins to envelop him. No matter how hard he cries, they will not pull the switch.<br/><br/>Now fully surrounded by white light, he sees an object floating towards him: his living reflection! The Reflection Max tells Actual Max that the reflections have already taken over Erin and Zack and now it is Max's turn. Max does not think living for eternity in a mirror sounds so hot, so he escapes. Somehow he manages to outrun his reflection and appears in the flesh, once Erin and Zack pull the cord. They ask him if he has made the switch and he says nothing. Then the Reflection Max gets seen in the mirror and tells them that Actual Max got away.<br/><br/>Erin tells Reflection Max no problem and Zack pulls the cord again. Actual Max tries running out of the attic, but Erin and Zack block his way. He yells to April to go get help, but she gets blocked by Erin and Zack. Just when all hope is lost, Lefty appears in the attic, sees the reflection of the invisible Max in the mirror, and tosses him the ball. The ball shatters the mirror, sucking Max's reflection into the shards. Lefty holds onto the door frame while Erin and Zack also get sucked into the mirror and then spit back out again.<br/><br/>Max and Lefty reflect on the end of their adventure while tossing around a ball in the backyard. It is then that Max discovers that Lefty is throwing right-handed.",,,1,0

The beginning of the book, where there are no discoveries and mummies is pretty fine for a food start with simple characters and clean writing about a teens worries. But later, as the book progresses, the mummy's tomb, abduction, exploring the depths ere supposed to be interesting but were dull and it did not at all give me Goosebumps. The mummies come alive on the fifth last page, and go back to the dead again. There's no logic at all in Ahmed's Character. Sat and Gabe are interesting. The scorpions, mummy hand, priestess chamber were also pretty okay. The ending was completely unsuspectable. That's all that I have to say about this. <br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Twelve-year-old Gabe Sabry is spending Christmas vacation in Egypt with his parents. Gabe's parents own a refrigeration company, so they are in Egypt for business. However, their relative Uncle Ben is working at the pyramids and so they take the opportunity to see him.<br/><br/>Back in al-Jizah (Giza), Gabe tries to relax in the hotel room, but the television does not show anything in English. Gabe's parents get a call-- there is a refrigeration emergency inAlexandria, they have to rush out on a airplane that leaves in an hour! They give Gabe an option: He can go with them to exciting Alexandria, or stay in boring Cairo with Uncle Ben. Gabe elects to stay with the archaeologist, even though he does not get along with Ben's twelve-year-old stuck-up daughter,Sari.<br/><br/>Since Uncle Ben is on his way to pick up Gabe, Gabe's parents leave him alone in the hotel so they can catch their airplane. As he is waiting, Gabe removes a mummy's hand from his jeans pocket that he had bought at a garage sale several years ago and carries around with him. He hears someone breaking into his hotel room: it is a mummy! Gabe throws the mummy hand at the mummy, who is revealed to actually be Uncle Ben in a mummy disguise! His cousin Sari and Uncle Ben start cracking up.<br/><br/>Uncle Ben reveals that he is in such a good mood, because he and his team have just discovered a secret burial chamber inside one of the Great Pyramids. And the best news of all is that both Gabe and Sari get to accompany him into the tombs.<br/><br/>Uncle Ben treats the children to dinner in the hotel lobby. As they eat, Uncle Ben prepares the children for their adventure by giving out facts about the pyramids.<br/><br/>The next morning, the three trek down to the pyramid. Uncle Ben flashes a guard his badge and the three prepare to head inside, but first Ben poses the following question to Gabe: ""You don't believe in curses, do you? You know-- the ancient Egyptian kind.""<br/><br/>Ben alerts the children that his workers may have violated an ancient Egyptian decree and unleashed a curse. He also warns the two about getting lost in the tunnels several times. Each of the three are armed with halogen flashlights and the temperature drops significantly once inside the giant stone building.<br/><br/>As they walk along the dark corridor, Uncle Ben gives even more Pyramid facts. Since his crews just cut holes from one room to the next, there are not any accessible stairwells that lead to the new chamber, so the only way to get to the room below is via a rope ladder. Ben goes down first so he can shine his light up at the entrance, and Gabe, wanting to show off for Sari, jumps confidently onto the rope ladder. However, he was not expecting the rope to be coarse and he draws his hands away in pain. Gabe falls down to his doom until Sari saves the day by grabbing his hand and guiding him back to the rope ladder. Uncle Ben tells Gabe to take his time and eventually all three make their way down the lower part of the pyramid.<br/><br/>Gabe's shoelaces keep coming untied as the three trek through a downhill passage. This passage leads to a forked passage and Uncle Ben leads them through a tight, claustrophobic passage that they have to walk through sideways. This leads to the Northwest Passage. Eventually they find themselves in a large, cavernous room with a high ceiling. Spotlights hooked up to generators hang from the walls, revealing four of Uncle Ben's workers excavating the tomb, plus one noticeably non-helpful Egyptian dressed in all white with a red handkerchief. Uncle Ben introduces this quiet pony-tailed figure as Ahmed, a man from ""university"" there to serve as a consultant on ancient curses.<br/><br/>Uncle Ben turns his attention to his workers and Gabe directs Sari's attention to the dirt inside the pyramid.  Sari yearns for more excitement and talks Gabe into exploring the pyramid. She insists that it is safe, because she did it yesterday and all the passageways eventually lead back to the main room. Of course as soon as they make their way down a passage and Gabe turns around, Sari disappears.<br/><br/>Gabe continues walking down the tunnel, convinced that Sari is playing a trick on him. He comes across a small square room with a stone casket inside. Slowly the painted lid of the case slides off and Gabe sees the eyes of the creature within. Sari throws a fit of hysterics at spooking her cousin. Uncle Ben barges in and yells at the two about wandering off in the pyramid, only to join in the laughter when Sari fills him in on her prank. Gabe sulks and follows Ben and Sari out of the tomb.<br/><br/>The next morning, the three are eating breakfast in their hotel room. Uncle Ben has to conduct a little business inside the Cairo Museum. But he proposes the two children tag along, so they can wander the museum while he works. No sooner is this mentioned than it is dashed away by a telephone call. Apparently two of Uncle Ben's workers have fallen mysteriously ill and he has to go visit them in the hospital. He sternly tells the two children to stay put in the hotel (they can leave the room if they want but not the hotel itself) until he gets back. As soon as he is gone Gabe tries to show off for Sari by proposing they go to the Cairo Museum on their own. Gabe writes a note for his uncle and the two head out.<br/><br/>Inside the giant museum, Gabe teaches Sari about the grotesque methods the Egyptians used to prep a dead body for mummification. Gabe describes the process of first inserting a hook into the eye socket or nostril of the corpse and then stirring the brain around until it is pliable to be scooped out with a spoon. Gabe starts to embellish around the time he gets to the part where the Egyptians would occasionally cut off a head and let the brains drain out through the neck.<br/><br/>Ahmed shows up at the museum and spooks the children. They run away from him but he catches up with them and claims that Uncle Ben sent him to take them back to the hotel. Even though they walked only two blocks to the hotel, Ahmed insists they drive back in his station wagon. Ahmed drives away in the opposite direction of the hotel, kidnapping the children.<br/><br/>Inside the car, Gabe signals to his cousin to run out whenever Ahmed stops. The plan works and the children run into the busy streets of Cairo, eventually seeking solace in a department store. The two are relieved to have escaped Ahmed's clutches but begin to panic when they realize they are lost in Cairo. They hail a cab and tell the driver to go to the Cairo Hotel but the driver doesn't pull out. He just sits in the front seat laughing at the children. Not quite getting the joke, the children begin to panic, fearing that the driver is in cahoots with Ahmed. Still laughing, the cab driver points through the windshield at the Cairo Hotel. Sari and Gabe trot up to their room and make it inside just before Uncle Ben arrives.<br/><br/>Ben's clearly distraught over the mysterious illness of his workers-- they will not reveal anything to him, leading him to suspect something wicked is afoot. He tells the children that he gave the rest of his workers the day off but he simply must go back to the pyramid and investigate. He proposes the children wait for him inside the hotel room but they fear Ahmed might return. Uncle Ben reluctantly agrees to take the two children with him.<br/><br/>Outside the pyramid, Uncle Ben clips special pagers to their belts. In case the children get lost, they can press a button on the beeper and the device will transmit a homing device for their uncle. Before entering the pyramid, Gabe pauses to make sure he has the mummy hand.<br/><br/>Shortly after entering the pyramid, Gabe gets lost. He stops to tie his shoe and then when he looks up the other two are gone. He resists hitting the panic button because he thinks he can catch up with them. He comes across the fork in the path from earlier and he enters the wrong passageway and falls through the stone floor, crashing into a hidden burial room. As he looks up from the rubble he spots a mummy standing at attention, motionless against the opposite wall. Gabe gets up and shines his flashlight around the huge room-- the auditorium-sized room is at least twice as tall as the tomb being excavated by Uncle Ben's team.<br/><br/>Inside there are dozens of mummies in various positions and a table with the tools used to prepare the mummies. Gabe shines his light on a dark square in the floor the size of a swimming pool. He walks closer and discovers the dark spot is a pool of molten tar. Gabe questions how the tar could possibly be soft after all this time locked away in the crypt. Finally he has had enough adventure and decides to beep his uncle. Unfortunately, the fall crushed the pager. Gabe is on his own. It gets worse for Gabe as he becomes aware that parts of the room are moving. It's not the mummies though-- it's scorpions. A wave of the dangerous insects convenes across the floor and rushes towards a frantic Gabe. In his panic, Gabe trips and falls headfirst into the pile of scorpions.<br/><br/>Sari also got lost and also made her way into the cavernous room. She grabs onto Gabe just as he is falling into the scorpions. The two make their way to a new area of the tomb and Sari explains that she got split up from her father too and that he was so mad at Gabe for getting lost. Gabe reasons that she is lost too and that Ben will get over it once he sees the tomb. Sari directs Gabe to the tunnel entrance in the corner of the room that she came through and the two make their way over. Gabe makes Sari page for her father so they can be saved. Shortly after beeping her father, Sari sees a light coming through the tunnel.<br/><br/>Ahmed tells the children that he tried to warn Sari's father about the curse, but he just would not listen. The children have violated the Sacred Chamber of Princess Khala, and violating a sacred chamber comes at a price: death. Ahmed reveals that he tried to scare Uncle Ben's workers to prove that the curse was alive by showing them what it would feel like to be boiled alive in the tar pit. Ahmed in his duty as the descendant of Khala has punished all who entered the tomb. He reveals that the dozens of mummies inside the tomb consist mostly of recent violators of Princess Khala's chamber-- and they were mummified alive.<br/><br/>Ahmed draws a dagger and makes his way towards the children. Gabe suggests making a run for it when a rope ladder drops from the ceiling. Uncle Ben swoops down and confronts Ahmed. Ben tries to reason with Ahmed: ""Ahmed, you are a scientist, and so am I."" Ahmed declines Ben's offer to handle the situation ""scientist to scientist,"" opting instead to hit Ben in the head as hard as he can with his torch.<br/><br/>Sari runs over to her father's bloody body and pleads to Ahmed to let them go. Ahmed pulls the torch back and swings it behind him, letting it drop into the tar pit. The pit bursts into bright flames. Ahmed turns around and tells the children they are going to have to wait for it to heat up.<br/><br/>Ahmed hoists Uncle Ben's body into a stone sarcophagus and closes the lid. Gabe worries that if he is still alive, Ben might not have enough air inside the coffin.  He and Sari get shoved into a rotting, wooden coffin. Gabe notes that the coffin he is sharing with his cousin is filled with gross bugs. Sari and Gabe hear a rustling inside their coffin. It's Uncle Ben.<br/><br/>The Egyptians built their caskets with escape hatches in the bottom so the soul can escape. Ahmed is so wrapped up in chanting an ancient spell that he did not even notice Ben slipping out the hatch and into the other coffin. Ben tells the children that Ahmed has slipped out of the tomb and the three slide out the secret coffin passage. They trot across the tomb and almost make it out when they spot Ahmed's torchlight. Ahmed draws his dagger and forces them backwards towards the tar pit. Finally he has them lined up with their backs facing the bubbling pit. He tells the family that they will have to jump one by one into the pit, which is still burning with a low flame over the boiling surface.<br/><br/>In a moment of panic, Gabe pulls out the mummy's hand from his jeans and lifts it above his head. Ahmed flips and cries out that it is the Hand of the Priestess. Ahmed starts chanting in a foreign language. Behind him all of the mummies in the room begin to move. They slowly scrape their way towards Ahmed. Ahmed circles around and cries out in horror. He throws the torch at an advancing mummy. The mummy bursts into flames but keeps walking towards Ahmed. A group of mummies hoists Ahmed over their heads and lift him above the tar pit. The family looks away, as the mummies drop Ahmed into the pit. Strangely, when they open their eyes, the mummies are back to their original positions and they spot Ahmed running through the tomb's exit in terror.<br/><br/>Back at the hotel, Gabe is toying around with his mummy's hand. Jokingly he cries out to the ancient spirits, summoning them to life. Sari and Gabe hear a knock on the hotel door. When they go to answer, they discover... Gabe's parents are back!",,,1,0

The characters are great, each unique, scary, amusing, comedy, cowardly and the plot setting is fantastic which makes you wonder what happens next. I found a few similarities like in the previous books. The story develops really well with simple plotline and major changes. I learned a lot of new terms from the book. The one thing that I notice in Goosebumps book series is that the end of the chapter is a horrific (Not that much, but still.) But the next chapters beginning reveals that's it isn't much a big deal. The house, Spidey, Origin of Camera, Greg's and his friends personality is what I lollies in The book. Obviously it has a few flaws but its worth to read. And its short too. Finished in 120 minutes straight.<br/>Plot<br/>While wondering what to do on a boring summer day, four friends named Greg, Michael, Doug (nicknamed Bird) and Shari decide to investigate the Coffman House, an old, abandoned house which revolves around several spooky and freaky stories. It is the home of a strange, old man nicknamed ""Spidey"", because of his spider-like appearance. While searching the home, Greg discovers a strange camera within a hidden compartment in a basement wall. Given his interest in photography, Greg takes a picture of his friend Michael who is leaning on the basement stair railing. Suddenly, the railing gives way and Michael falls. Michael is found to have hurt his ankle upon landing. Greg discovers that the picture does not show Michael standing by the railing at all, but instead falling. While the friends cannot come up with a logical explanation for the strange photograph, all discussion ceases when footsteps are heard and the four friends flee the house taking the camera with them.<br/>As time goes on Greg takes a picture of his father's new car, but the picture depicts the car totally wrecked. Later, Greg takes a picture of his brother Terry, who is in his bedroom on his computer. But the picture shows him elsewhere, in a worried state, and in front of a house.<br/>The next day, Greg goes to his friend Bird's baseball game; a picture of Doug is taken and the picture depicts him lying on the ground with his neck bent in an unnatural angle. Doug dismisses this idea and even fakes the picture's scene coming true, in an attempt to show Greg and Shari that the camera is simply broken. However, while playing the game he is hit by an oncoming baseball. In fact, he lands in such a way that his neck is bent into the unnatural angle. Now, Greg is convinced that the camera is somehow responsible, but his friends are still unwilling to believe these ideas. It is at this point that Terry's picture comes true, as he approaches Greg and claims that their father was in an accident and the car is totally wrecked.<br/>Greg then has a nightmare of taking a picture of his family during a backyard barbecue, but is horrified to see them as skeletons.<br/>Shari, still skeptical of the camera's powers, has Greg bring the camera to her birthday party and insists that he takes her picture. Greg reluctantly agrees but finds that when the picture develops, only the background has come out and Shari is nowhere to be seen. Not long afterwards, Shari disappears.<br/>In the days that follow, Greg's picture is taken and he sees that he and Shari are panicked by a shadow that comes over them. Greg is worried, yet hopeful, when he sees this picture. Because at this point, Shari is still missing, but the picture clearly shows Shari.<br/>Shari remains missing for days, until Greg tears up the picture. Shari then returns as suddenly and mysteriously as she disappeared. She apparently has no memory of where she went.<br/>While talking to Greg about her disappearance, the picture of the two being panicked by a shadow over them comes true when Spidey appears before them. He chases them for a while, until a neighbor threatens to call the police on him. They finally are safe.<br/>Finally, deciding that the camera is too dangerous to be kept, Greg and Shari decide to return it to its hiding place in Spidey's home.

Spidey turns out to be a mad scientist, named Dr. Fritz Fredericks, and his lab partner had created the camera. However, Spidey, being greedy, decided to steal the camera and market it as his own invention. But his partner was evil- not only a scientist, but a master of the dark arts, and he decided that if he could not profit from the camera, no-one would. He put a curse on the camera making it show bleak future events which would then occur and it was impossible to break, meaning that the camera would survive till the end of the world.<br/>Spidey says that the camera caused the deaths of people he loved. Spidey had spent most of his life trying to keep the camera from being discovered and had sacrificed all he held dear to do so, but now that Shari and Greg know it's true power, he is afraid that they will divulge it's truths, and so he resolves to keep them imprisoned in his home forever. However, during a struggle with Greg and Shari, his picture is accidentally taken with the camera and he dies of fright. The picture depicts this very event occurring. With the camera returned to its hiding place, Shari and Greg finally escape the building. They notify the Pitts Landing police, saying that they discovered Spider's body in the house after running in to escape the rain, and believe it to be over.<br/>At the end of the story two bullies named Joey Ferris and Mickey Ward, who had previously shown interest in the camera, are shown to have found the camera after following Greg to the Coffman house.

Does Stine think that kids are influential or are adults very wise? Anyways, this book ""Monster Blood"" is totally different from the rest of to series. The idea of Monster Blood is not at all scary (At least when you read it. I wouldn't want to be Evan) nor is is very funny or thrilling. Simplicity is the key to Stines writing and it was a simple three hour read. Katherine is a formidable character, Evan is a scared rabbit, Andy is playful, Bullies are Bullies and the Monster Blood is a disgusting menace is what I can say after reading this. The ending was quite nice, the witch summoning and all and you would least expect it after Tue menacing centralized characters. The young children are the sufferers as always in the Goosebumps series. I did not have high expectations from the book.(The series, really) but it was fun to read. Nice, casual and sometimes very funny  and it had a happy ending(unlike others). Short review for a short book.<br/><br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>The book opens with twelve-year-oldEvan Ross being dropped off with his creepy old aunt Kathryn for a few days, while his parents go house-hunting inGeorgia. Kathryn is an eighty-year-old deaf woman, who never learned to read lips or use sign language. When we first meet Kathryn, she is busy cutting up meat in the kitchen and greets her guests with a bloody knife.<br/><br/>Evan has brought his cocker spaniel, Trigger, with him for company. But his aunt wants him tied up outside so that he will not chase her black cat, Sarabeth. Evan decides instead to take Trigger for a walk around the neighborhood, where he meets a cute girl his age named Andrea — who then tells him she goes by the name Andy. Evan gets excited and he readily accepts her invitation to accompany her into town. She rides her new bike quickly to town, forcing Evan and Trigger to run alongside the entire way.<br/><br/>Once in town, Evan quickly takes inventory of the shops. There is a video store, but he figures his aunt probably does not even have a VCR. Andy reveals that she has to buy a present for her cousin's birthday, so they stop in one of the two toy stores downtown. Inside Wagner's Novelties & Sundries, the children find a metal can with the label ""MONSTER BLOOD: SURPRISING MIRACLE SUBSTANCE"". The shopkeeper tries to stop the purchase and warns them not to return the tin, if they take it home and discover it does not work.<br/><br/>Evan takes Andy back to Kathryn's house, so they can investigate the tin of Monster Blood. Andy thinks Kathryn's house is super cool and dreams about being able to read all the leather-bound books on magic that line the shelves. Upstairs, the children uncap the tin and discover a glowing green substance. It bounces, glows in the dark, and is cool to the touch. Because the Monster Blood leaves stains on the floor and wall, they decide to take it outside. They roll the blood up into a ball and bounce it back and forth amongst themselves. Finally, Trigger grows weary and decides to eat a gob of Monster Blood.<br/><br/>The next morning, Trigger is not feeling well. So Evan treks out into the neighborhood by himself. He runs into two fourteen year old twins dressed in black. Rick and Tony Beymer harass the wimpy Evan, who tries to joke with the two bullies in means of coming out unharmed. Luckily for Evan, Andy comes to his rescue and she tries to scare away the twins. Which only results in them turning their attention to pestering her. Thankfully, the twins just swipe her bike and do not hit her, but she does get knocked down in the scuffle. Evan does not bring attention back to himself and Andy runs home to clean her scraped leg.<br/><br/>Back home, Evan finds Trigger choking in the backyard. It seems either the dog's grown larger or the leash has grown smaller. They discover the tin of Monster Blood is now overflowing with the green goop. Also, the gelatinous substance is no longer cool to the touch, but instead feels disturbingly warm. This is not enough however to discourage the children from having a Monster Blood fight. The two fling Monster Blood at each other inside Evan's bedroom. But then they start cleaning up the mess, when they suddenly hear a horrifying howl from down below. Evan rushes to the window with Andy right behind him and she points out that Trigger has doubled in size!<br/><br/>The dog, who is now the size of a pony, rushes out of the backyard. Evan and Andy try to run after it, but they do not get very far before Trigger turns into a horrible monster. And then Evan wakes up from the dream! He slowly realizes that the bed he is in is too small. He is a giant monster or something! Then he wakes up again...<br/><br/>Evan and Andy take Trigger to the vet in order to get him check out. But the doctor tells them the dog is having a rare growth spurt and then sends them on their way. Andy then rushes off to her piano lesson.<br/><br/>Left alone, Evan decides to buy himself an ice cream treat at the local market. He leaves Trigger tied up outside. When he returns with his ice cream sandwich, Ricky and Tony are stealing his dog. Trigger gets angry and once let loose, chases after the twins. Evan becomes terrified as he remembers how this happened in his dream and he begins to worry that he might turn into a monster, just like in his second dream.<br/><br/>Back home, Evan calls Andy and asks if he can see her, claiming it to be an emergency. Upon arriving, he shows Andy the full bucket of Monster Blood, before pleading with her to take some of it. She agrees to take a coffee cans worth.  However, when she scoops the can into the bucket, the Blood scoops back. Andy freaks out as the Blood sucks the can right into the middle of the bucket. When Evan fishes his hands in to retrieve the can, he tells her he can feel the suction, like it is alive!<br/><br/>As Evan is leaving Andy's house, the twins surprise him by beating him up. Andy helps Evan scoop the Monster Blood back into the overturned bucket, then comes up with a foolproof plan: they'll just return the Monster Blood to the toy store.<br/><br/>Evan sneaks back home and realizes he needs to find a new container for the ever-growing Monster Blood. He empties the bucket into an old bathtub in the garage. Suddenly Sarabeth, the cat, pounces on him and he falls into the tub of Monster Blood. Evan narrowly escapes getting sucked into the muck.<br/><br/>The next morning at breakfast, Evan decides he has to tell someone else about the Monster Blood. He writes Kathryn a brief note on a legal pad and she just laughs at him and his imagination. Evan calls Andy to see if she is ready, which she suggests he use a plastic lawn sack to carry the Monster Blood. The two drag several lawn bags worth of breathing Monster Blood down several blocks to the toy store, which turns out to be closed...forever!<br/><br/>The two lug the sacks all the way back to Kathryn's house and empty the lawn sacks into a metal garbage can. As soon as they clamp shut the lid, Kathryn runs out of the house waving a yellow sheet of paper. Evan's mother just sent a telegram that she will be coming to pick him up that day.<br/><br/>Evan is so excited that he runs to tell his dog the good news.  When Evan opens the gate, he sees that Trigger has actually doubled in size. The beast leaps out of the backyard and into the streets. Evan runs after him but trips and knocks the trash can over. The large mass of Monster Blood spills out and tries to swallow him. Evan moves out just in time and he and Andy run down the street as the large rolling ball of Monster Blood moves quickly after them.<br/><br/>They run into the twins, and they are shortly swallowed up by the Monster Blood. The children stop to stare at the still outlines of the twins' bodies inside the giant heap of Monster Blood.  The children split up so that at least one of them have a chance, but Kathryn chooses this time to stick her head out of the house. The Monster Blood rolls into the house after Kathryn.<br/><br/>The children run into the house to save Kathryn and find her trapped in the corner, the huge round blob of Monster Blood about to engulf her. She cries out that she is responsible for the Monster Blood and she will have to pay with her life.  Evan accuses his great-aunt of trying to kill him by casting a spell on the Monster Blood but she insists it wasn't her who put the spell on the Monster Blood. She points towards the other side of the room and cries out, ""It was her.""  She is pointing to Sarabeth the cat, who then transforms into a beautiful young woman wearing a black cape.<br/><br/>Kathryn explains that twenty years ago, Sarabeth cast a spell on her that made her a slave. She also made her deaf and refused to let her learn sign language or lip-read so she could control her better. Sarabeth did not allow Kathryn to have visitors. So when Evan showed up, Sarabeth insisted she cast a spell on the Monster Blood to get rid of him. Kathryn tells Sarabeth that she is going to end the spell by letting the Monster Blood swallow her, thus ending Sarabeth's hold on her. Sarabeth tells her that she is still going to kill the children and raises her hands to command the Monster Blood to kill them and they brace for their on-coming deaths. Suddenly Trigger leaps through the door, pushing Sarabeth into the Monster Blood.<br/><br/>Sarabeth is completely engulfed in the ball of Blood and soon Trigger quickly shrinks back down to normal size and the children look over at the dwindling ball of Monster Blood. The two twins get spit out and they immediately run from the house. Just as Evan's mother wanders in and asks why those two boys were running from the house.<br/><br/>Andy and Evan say their goodbyes soon after. Evan tells her he would like to write to her, while she mentions she can call him with her father's phone card. But she then asks him for just one favor: she would like to keep some of the Monster Blood as a souvenir.<br/><br/>When they go to collect the Monster Blood, they discover it has vanished.",,,1,0

It follows a simple storyline, which turns and twist but in a particular fashion. 5 characters, 1 house, 1 experiment, 100 plants. The name ""Stay oil it of the basement"" stays true as most of the work is under the basement and its really creepy to see your parent turning weird and unresponsive and completely different. That's what happens in the book. It is okay, but not very much good. Characters are okay. Storyline is good. Its a short read o take the most out of your day but lacks chilling and descriptive narratives.<br/>Plot<br/>Siblings Margaret and Casey Brewerare playing Frisbee outside on a surprisingly warm winter day inCalifornia . Casey attempts to throw the frisbee to Dr. Brewer - his father - but he gruffly declines because he has too much work to do in the basement. Casey and Margaret's father is a scientist, specifically a botanist, and ever since he got fired from PolyTech, he's spent all his time in the basement, experimenting with his work. When Margaret and Casey try to go down to the basement to see their father, he appears at the bottom of the stairs, holding his bloodied right hand under the light, and bellows ""Stay out of the Basement!"". Soon after, their mother, Mrs. Brewer then has to leave forTucson to visit her sister Eleanor (the kids' Aunt) in hospital. Mrs. Brewer reminds Casey, Margaret and even Margaret's friend Diane to be nice to Dr. Brewer and make sure he 'eats something once in a while'.<br/><br/>Once Dr. Brewer emerges from the basement, his hand is still bandaged as he leaves to take Mrs. Brewer to the airport. While the kids are hanging out in the living room, Diane suggests they go down to the basement and quickly see what Dr. Brewer' has been working on. After some initial complaining Casey agrees with the girls and even mentions that he'll go first. As they make their way down into the basement, they notice their fathers workroom is stacked to the ceiling with a variety, tall yet jungle-like plants. Some of the plants are bearing fruit, yet they all appear to be very large given they had only been growing for five to six weeks.<br/><br/>Casey strips down to his waist due to the intense humidity of the basement, and forgets his shirt there. He notices a large glass contraption similar to a phone booth hooked up to a generator in one corner. He walks over to touch it and pretends as though his bare body jolts with electric shocks. After admonishing him for his 'hilarious' prank, by tickling his bare chest and stomach, the girls stop to listen to the plants, which sound as though they are breathing. The tendrils of some of the plants begin to move 'like human arms shifting their positions', as if beckoning the children towards the plants, and indeed some of the plants were drawing long breaths in and letting the air escape with a 'sigh'. The children wisely decide to stay out of the basement after all, and scatter out just as Dr. Brewer pulls up in the driveway.<br/><br/>Suddenly Casey, looking down at his bare chest, remembers that he left his shirt down in the basement. He quickly runs down into the basement to retrieve, but is overcome by a wave of fear. He begins to hear the breathing and moaning of the plants again, amidst Margaret’s calls to ‘Hurry!’ He sees his shirt and moves slowly to get it but he is grabbed around the waist by two long tendrils of a plant. By this time Margaret has come down to help and they both pull at the tendrils until they go slack. As they race back to the bottom of the basement stairs they see their father glaring down angrily at them from the top.<br/><br/>Dr. Brewer calmly sits them down at the kitchen table and tells them that one day he will explain everything in the basement and they will all go down together, but until that day, they are not allowed in the basement. The next morning Margaret is surprised to find‘her father was already at work, the basement door was shut tight, and a lock had been installed on the door.’<br/><br/> The next Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Brewer is on the phone with Margaret to tell her that her sister's surgery did not go as planned and she will be staying in Tucson a few more days. Margaret tells her mother about the basement and how Dr. Brewer has started wearing a Dodgers cap at all times. Mrs. Brewer tells her daughter that her father probably feels like he has something to prove to Mr. Martinez, his old boss. <br/><br/>After getting off the telephone with her mother, Margaret heads downstairs and spying on her father eating in the kitchen from a plastic bag. She soon discovers he is eating plant food! She tells Casey about this as she makes him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but he does not seem to think it is all that weird that their father would be eating fertiliser. He then mocks her by pretending to be the Incredible Plant Man and she is Weed Woman.<br/><br/>A few days later, the two siblings and Diane are playing Frisbee, again. Casey tosses a Frisbee at their father, who has emerged briefly into the sunlight, but it hits him in the head, knocking his Dodgers cap off and revealing green leaves growing on his scalp! Dr. Brewer finally sits down with his children and explains that the leaves are just a side effect-- a side effect to what, he will not say, but he does explain his experiments. He asks if the children are familiar with DNA. He is trying to take animal cells and put them into plant cells to create hybrid plants that have never existed. The glass booths in the basement are his transports, and though he is real close to succeeding, he has not quite made it work yet. He then brushes off all the moral and ethical concerns of his children as he heads back to the basement. <br/><br/>That night, Margaret again spies on her father in the bathroom. She watches him take off his bandage and the blood from his wound is bright green! She runs back to her room scared, unsure if her father saw her. After lying in bed for a while unable to sleep, she heads downstairs to the kitchen for a drink, jumping at the sight of Casey, who also couldn’t sleep. They hear more ‘human sounding’ noises from the basement. Before heading back to sleep, Margaret also takes a peek in his bedroom and notices that his bed is filled with moist dirt and crawling with worms.<br/><br/>The next afternoon, Margaret tells Casey all about her spying discoveries from the night before. Suddenly, Dr. Brewer appears and tells his children that he has made them lunch. The two are served what appear to be green mashed potatoes, and their father yells at them, and continually insists that they eat it. Luckily for the children, the doorbell rings and Dr. Brewer leaves to talk to Mr. Martinez, who has stopped by to check on Dr. Brewer's progress. The two children quickly scoop their green food into the trash and tell their father that they ate it.<br/><br/>The next day, Dr. Brewer tells his children he will be out for a few hours to help their neighbour install a bathroom sink. The children see this as their chance to further investigate the basement. As soon as he leaves, Casey picks the lock and they head downstairs. They come across Mr. Martinez's suit, neatly folded and hidden near a table. Then they realize that neither saw Mr. Martinez leave the house after visiting yesterday.<br/><br/>The two hear footsteps up in the house and realize their father has come back, so they quickly escape via the small rectangular basement window out into the backyard. The two emerge from the yard into the kitchen just in time to be caught by Dr. Brewer. He explains that Mr. Martinez simply got hot in the tropical climate of the basement and took off his suit and left without it. Dr. Brewer heads out to continue work on the sink. Before he goes, he threatens the children again, saying ‘Don’t go back in the basement, okay? It really could be dangerous. You could be very sorry.’<br/><br/>They next day Margaret returns from a bike ride with Dianne as Dr. Brewer is leaving to pick up Mrs. Brewer from the airport, and Casey mentions that he wants to fly kites in the backyard. The kids realise they are in the basement, so Casey picks the lock again and they go looking for them. They rummage around some lower shelves in the basement before finding the rest of Mr. Martinez’s clothes, realising their father had lied to them the previous day.<br/><br/>They suddenly hear loud repetitive thudding from the large supply closet in the basement. They agree to pry off the lock and open it, and inside they find strange plants with human looking features. Margaret then sees a pair of even more human looking feet behind the plants, before venturing in and discovering her father tied up on the floor with plant tendrils and gagged with elastic tape. They are confused given they thought their father has just left for the airport. They are hesitant to untie their dad, who says that the man who just left for the airport is a plant copy of him; however they give in and free him. Dr. Brewer then quickly makes his way across the basement and grabs an axe.<br/><br/>The ‘plant’ Dr. Brewer suddenly appears at the top of the basement stairs after returning home from the airport. He then falsely claims that the closet Dr. Brewer is the plant copy, in order to trick the kids. Margaret then leaps forward and grabs the axe from her father’s hands. She wields the axe around, confused as to which Dr. Brewer is her real father. She tells Casey to grab a knife for her from the tools hanging on the wall, before she pushes it into her real fathers arm, making a tiny puncture wound. The ‘plant’ Dr. Brewer then screams at Margaret saying she’s wrong, however it’s not long before the real Dr. Brewer swings his axe down into the plant copy, splitting him in two to reveal green ooze and stem-like insides. <br/><br/>One week later, Dr. Brewer is burning almost all of plant's plants in his yard, except a few that were transplanted into the garden beds. He tells his children that he wants to discontinue his experiments permanently. Meanwhile, one of the smaller plants begins to prod Margaret with its leaves while whispering ""Margaret, help me. Please - help me. I’m your father! Really! I’m your real father.""",,,1,0

I simply cannot grasp at the fact that A Monster Calls is Patricks debut novel 'cause the works really brilliant. This story and novel reflects Patrick's writing style how it will eventually develop in his upcoming novels. Speaking of the book itself, it was quite short, I managed to finished it in a day. The  idea that sparked the storyline was phenomenal. Mind you, the narration is straight and simple but there are elemtns in the story that will amaze and engross you in it's original and fresh ventures into unventured territories. Patrcik has a remarkable skill to virtually tleport the reader into one of his setting and his firsthand narration expereinee makes the character appear upfront and visually appeal tot he readers. I found the story very relatable and connectng. (Not that I fear my mother's demise by a critical illness), just that the emotional touch dedicated by the writer and the depth by which it is expressed is never seen before. The idea of the 'Monster' and how it delves into Corion's life, not teaching him lessons (as is the orthodox) but teaching him how to face reality and battle hard times. I think the novel has a phantasmagorial appeal to it and is revolutionary. The breakthrough appears to be unorthodox as Patrcik experiments with his ideas and his brilliance is evidently and widely seen on the paper. It also has a dystopian touch to it. The ending/conclusion/climax will make you reflect. The three tales were the essence of the book and served as a side unorthodox fairy( rather call it grim) tales which keep the reader hooked ot the main storyline. Engaging, Phantasmagorial, Unorthodox, Original and Emotionally moving novel brilliantly laid out with crisp and bold ideas that will blow the readers mind. No doubt this has a highly critical acclaim. I'm gonna watch the movie adaptation too, it's good apparently. Nice Reading! The foreword was enlightening btw!",,,2,0

Now, here I am writing a review of his twice Carnegie medal award winner globally acclaimed novel More Than This which is a phantasmagorical tale/story of a young boy who commits suicide and find himself in a dystopian world. Regardless to say, this is Patrick Ness at his best, outdoing himself. The author strives to deliver the inspiring message that there's a whole lot more to our lives than we know, what we need is to discover and embrace it. I would classify this book as Dystopian, Dark Humor, Young Adult, Fiction but to tell the truth, it's a peculiar and first of its kind book which deserves an entirely  new category. Its full of twists and turns when you least expect it to be. You are in for some ""Oh. My. God"" moments for sure. Moving towards the actual book, it's 480 pages, smooth paper, elegant font and typesetting and was a comfy pleasant reading experience. Patrick Ness has divided the book into four parts which is perfect because there's a cliffhanger/plot point at the end of each of these four parts which will surely deliver you endless surprises. Additionally to this, the character development rises rapidly in these four parts though the story remains consistent and smooth throughout. Right from the beginning, the story truly captivated me and I just couldn't put the book down until I was through the first part. The book sets up a tense, dark and grim atmosphere by trasnproting the major character Seth into a alternate world. You'll definitely want to avoid spoilers while reading this book. I was intrigued my the book, it made me reflect upon the relationship between death and life and about its endless cycle. Patrick Ness does not hold back on language, explicitness and delivers a dark humor and a thrilling storyline. Seth's oblivious viewpoint to this afterworld makes the story quite interesting, inf fact it reminded me of Limbo (Video Game) and how the geographical setting of the Afterworld matches with it. Then there's some serious action, fighting, escaping, brutal kills and rescues. Another key plot point of the book is it's dream flashback when Seth falls into slumbers. I truly enjoyed the flashbacks about Seth's life in the 'said' Real World and how it influences the present storyline. The book also showcases strong language, LGBT scenes and creates a normality regarding gender bender storyline so teenagers who face problems should definitely pick this book up and feel inspired. The author has laid down a very powerful theory which I'm willing to believe because it's damn rational and 100% possible and there's no flaws, loopholes in this theory which amazed me- That this world is a simulation, a trick of technology where we have uploaded our lives and are just a model in it. What we call 'Hell' is the actual world, fallen into oblivion and darkness due to humanities greed. Just read the book and you'll understand. What amazes me the most is how the author blends in multiple genres, fuses the past and the present to make a perfect storyline, reaches the readers hearts and inspires him/her to discover that life is more than what it seems to be, balancing philosophy and action and providing some wise messages to the reader. You'll even pick up some survival skills from the book. In fact this book may boost your productivity and intelligence about facts and fiction. Undoubtedly, this book will impress anyone and everyone, I couldn't resist reading chunks and chunks of it. I adored the character of Tomasz and Regine and their pasts too. The author leaves the climax unexplained with endless possibilities over which readers can ponder. The Afterworld created by Patrick Ness deserves a never ending applause. It's detail, geography, 'The Driver', the ingenious idea of the AfterWorld being the real world and the people living in simulations is impossible to imagine, but of course Patrick Ness makes Impossible Possible. The book also reflects strong emotions, despair, hope, psychological effects on the youth, bravery, consequences, young life and stimulates the mind and soul of the reader. I was enthralled by the straightforward and reflective narration style which was simplistic but left no detail out. There's a whole lot to the book than I can explain, it isn't what it appears, everything is a deception and reality is often questioned in the book. A unique and ingenious storytelling endeavor. This is a book I'll cherish and enjoy over the years. A definitely wonderful reading experience that nobody should miss. Simply Perfect. Recommended for Young Adults above the age of 14.

What can I say? This book is completely different from the first two in the series and feels as if it belongs to a completely different series. But thanks to the characters, Ash and Parvati who have succeeded in creating the Ash Mistry ambiance for reading. Anyways, the story changes completely and the burning question we readers had at the end of the second book are resolved and answered in the final book brilliantly. The introduction part is done well with a quick recap of what happened in the previous books and how Savage reverted back the timeline. Ash and Parvati have been thrown into an alternate timeline by Lord Savage, now immortal with the Kohinoor in his heart and master of all the ten sorceries. But unluckily for Ash, in this timeline, his powers do not work anymore. Things get really interesting when they meet Ash’s doppelganger, Ashoka Mistry and Parvati meets hers, Rani serving Alexander Savage. Once this is clear, the story begins where out characters go on a world tour, rescue their doppelgangers, try to murder Savage and stop his evil plan to take over the world by spreading the RAVN1 bio-hazardous fume that transform humans into demons. I was really sad to see Ash not being a Kali-aastra anymore. It takes away the magic from the book, but thanks to the author for introducing Ashoka to the storyline. Many dead characters have also found their way to be alive in this alternate timeline. Primary among them are Gemma, Uncle Vik and Anita, Rishi, Jat, Mayar, etc. all of them alliances as well as enemies. The characters journey to locations like India, London and China and even meet dragons and fight demons and reincarnated asuras. Ash gets captured and tormented. The story is good, but the magic from it feels vanished as Ash is not longer the almighty death bringer. He is substituted by a novice Ashoka who learns slowly but receptively. Also, it’s worth mentioning that Rani, Parvati’s doppelganger is evil, but Ash brainwashes her and makes her join the good side. There are various flashbacks, where Ashoka learns about his past life and gains experience from them. Lord Savage plays a good role of a villain, unstoppable and ruthless. The story is good but way too fictitious. Its impossible developing the RAVN1 gas, but after all, let us not forget that this is a fantasy/mythology series. Some scenes are vivid and rich, but full of violence or gore (I’m not complaining, I love them). This is not suitable for very young readers. (11+) coz the book contains deformities, Carnivals of Flesh, Cannibalistic giant monsters and blood sacrifices. Ash, Ashoka, Parvati, Rani form a good team and help fight off the malevolent and savage demons formed due to RAVN1, the much Loved Kali-aastra, Bramha-Aastra are brought back for complete annihilation. I loved the scene when Rishi finally appeared, this was just surprising. I don’t know, but this book felt much more like Alex Rider series because Ash does some spying, escaping and beating up the bad guys and other things like that. Anyways, a fantastic book with inspiring dialogues, a good story-line, humorous characters, well-planned scenes, visual effects and characters that have been stripped of their godly powers.

Its about 320 pages and I easily finished it within 3 days. It is addicting if you have some basic knowledge about Indian Mythology.<br/>  Ash Mistry Chronicles follows the adventure of a young European 13 year old Ash Mistry who along with his sister, Lucky and his uncle Vik has arrived in India for an educational tour with the prupose to explore its historical roots. The pace of the story is quite good, slow and quick as per as necessary. Also, battle scenes are quite frequent, in fact Mr. Sarwat has managed to add all the elements that need to be present in a book for a whole lot of entertainment. This book is underrated. As one progresses through the book, one comes across beautiful narration, buildings, the atmosphere in India, brief descriptions about towns and cities through Ash’s narrative. It talks about the struggles of an Indian origin boy who hates India. Things turn out to be really bad when his Uncle Vik has been given a 1M$ Cheque by Mr. Savage who is an ambitious researcher in terms of Geology and wants to discover the truth of things about the Harrapan Culture. Ash finds out that Mr. Savage is actually a powerful mage/sorcerer and his minions are a hoard of Demons. He discovers thee inner class of the town Varanasi, about the magical sages and the constant war between the Gods and the Demons happening throughout the world and trains in the field of battle to seek vengeance against Savage for the murder of his Uncle. The first half of the book serves as agood introduction and as it is by the narrative of a teenage child, YA readers can surely relate to the experience. The Fandom about Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Star Trek and other popular entertainment sources has been constatnly mentioned. Along with this the characters are powerful. I like the character of Parvati, who plays a key role in the future, she is the Demon Princess. The most intresting thing about the book is Ash’s journey in India and his grim discovery of supernatural things and his possesion of the Kali astra which change the story completely. I promise you, the story is simple but insuspectible. Also, some flashbacks about Lord Rama and his conquest against Ravana are seen frequently. Very similar to Percy Jackson, though not that good. Parvati, Ash, Lucky, Ravana, Savage are some of the protagonists, antagonists and stong supporting characters that will amaze you. Family bonds, human emotions, love,etc are highlighted throughout. The book has humour which made me laugh and relate to. Action Scenes are frequent and do not fail to entertain. The author has also thrown in some high vocabulary to fascinate the readers. The ending was good, but Ravana was defeated to easily. There are no flaws in the book but some arcs/parts may seem childish, lame. Still, a well balanced book which deserves more attention. It’s a trilogy, so two books more to go. Nice Reading!<br/>",,,1,0

Ash Mistry is back in this amazing sequel to to the Indian Mythology series that will surely entertain any young reader. This book has made many developments compared to its predecessor.  Ash Mistry is totally changed in this book, no longer he is a fatso, young geek boy who is scared of demons but on the contrary he is quite athletic, cool and ready to face challenges and demons head on now that he has defeated the Demon King Ravana. The book begins after three months after the aftermath from Jailsalmer and Ash is back in the US at his home. But life seems very different and better for him now. We see a lot less of Lucky here. There's a new additional character, Ash's crush, Gemma who plays a key role in the book. When Ash is trying to settle at his home and family, Parvati returns seeking Ash's help to find Lord Savage, the murderer of Ash's Unlce. But to Ash's disappointment Jackie, the demon arrives and kills Gemma due to a misunderstanding (which I won't explain here!). Due to this particular event, Ash's goal in the book is defined. To resurrect Gemma and to ill Savage. He accompanies Parvati on her quest to safe guard the Kohinoor, Bramha's Astra capable of bringing the dead back to life. A lot of things happen in the book, including Ash and Parvati's constant argument over the Kohinoor, introduction of friendly demons, introduction of loha-mukhas, like metal and rock demons, Ash being betrayed by John and thrown in a huge river current. The most important and influencing keypoint in the story is Ash being under the tutelage of Ujba and obtaining the total power of Kali due to which he gains supremacy over his senses. Finally, Ash strikes a temporary alliance with Savage and enters the City of Death in Lanka which is totally enchanted due to Ravanas's magic. The city is described very well with traps and bloody horrifying demons and ghosts that taint every corner. Also, Vibheeshana enters the plot, the mage, the wizard and the brother of the legendary Ravana who has the control of the eight legendary elemental abilities. The book ends when suddenly the timeline changes and Uncle Vick and Gemma being alive and almost everything and everyone's attitude changes and Ash feels like being transported to a different world, this is without a doubt the effect of Kohinoor. <br/>The book is written exceptionally well, with some trace of humour, but mostly the plot is surrounded by a dark and grim atmosphere that always captivates the attention of the reader and the book transforms itself into a definitive page turner. The chapters are comparatively short. I personally think that the Gemma phenomenon is overdone. The Kohinoor diamond and Parvati are one of the most important aspects. At the end, Savage's fate is not revealed but I'm hoping he lived, he's a unique villain. Much of the story takes place in temples, the City of Death, Sri Lanka, the cemetery of Kolkata and the US foreign states. Ash's personality has changed and he does not shun death but welcomes it, it is a ghastly transformation for a fifteen year old boy. The beginning serves an an introduction and the events after the aftermath. An interesting fact that I would like to share is that the beginning of the book is much better for Ash and the end of the book is again, much more better, but he has to go through a lot worse than anything in all those pages in the middle. I get that you don' actually understand what i just said, but your job is not to comprehend my reviews, it to read them and get motivated and actually pick up the respective book and finish it soon. I really like the new characters, the plotlines, the beautifully described and vivid locations, the playful use of words and the progression speed of the story.  I also forgot to mention that Ash can now travel back in the time and foresee the future. Wonderful addition to the Ash Mistry chronicles that will surely amaze you. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

This book has me on the edge of my seat for the entire read. It is not only the biggest book page-wise but my favourite in the series too. Derek Landy has been building up to this moment and as a reader we all have been very well acquainted with all the characters and therefore the book wastes no efforts and drags the read completely into the storytelling experience delivering some very satisfying and overwhelming character arcs and a perfect ending. I very much appreciate the author for trying out new ways and introducing a new narrative POV which might seem meaninglessly at first but as you approach the end it all makes so much more sense and the reader is left jarred at the final chapter. Overall, I was very tensed, concerned about my favourite characters. RIght from the beginning of the book, every characters missions and targets are made very clear and the story flows smoothly but at a very rapid rate and without a Doubt, Darquesse is portrayed as one of the most powerful Gillian in the fictional universe. A lot of chracters from the past books are mentioned, the events are realtors to what happens currently and also a whole crew of forgotten characters make an appearance and play a vital role in the storyline. Derek Landy expands so much on the lord of magic and the known world. I adored Skulduggery's and Vlakyrie's relationship and how she has to face her family once the reveal is over. IT all was fantastic and surprising. I was hooked to the book, it was an intensive journey and I devoured it in within 3 days. This page turner brings all the scattered prices and ties them together for an epic canvas of the entire series with a fortunate ending. This book was pretty violent but less so than the devious book and is suitable for younger children as long as they remember the events of the past books. The most important point that i'd like to mention is how the readers perceive Darquesse, Valkyrie and Stephanie as three different individuals and not the same person even though we know that at the root they spring from the same conciousness. A lot of philosophical ideas become clear and the imagination power of the author is evident with each page. The humour in the book is subtle and it outspoken like that in it's predecessors but I liked it like that. The book has some very sad moments and leaves you in sorrow and shocked but it also adds some sweet and delightful movements to make it all bittersweet. The character dynamics are taken to a whole new level in the book and I'm sure many people will notice this. The story progresses so much with each chapter and there are little tidbits that are worth noting and floating over by the hardcore's fans of the series. Derek Landy does an amazing job with balancing the expectations of the reader, delivering an efficient, fast-paced, super twisting story with adorable and relatable characters and enchants the reader with the relaistic narration. This series is definitely on my Top10 Fantasy Series of All TIme list and I'll surely reread it in a couple of ears. It's been one hell of a journey and I've never been disappointed by Derek Landy. The quotes and the dialogue exchanges really stood out. This has been a wild and exciting ride. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

The magnanimity and the epic standoff that this book delivers is at an entirely different peak and it all comes down to the plot and the multitude of characters involving with each other. At this point in the series where this is the penultimate book and surprises begin to show up with big battles and side quests spanning over 700 pages it is somewhat hard to process everything and remember what went down because the pacing of the story is so fast and detailed at the same time it makes you want to write a recap/summary of the each chapter but worry not SKUL-WIKIA (FANDOM) has a 10 paged detailed plot summary which really helps you t appreciate the collosal story that occured during the book. I have to acknowledge that though this series started off as a Young Adult, Middle Grade fantasy action it has quickly developed into a material that is more suitable for mature adults and critics looking for great depths and dynamic and world building throughout the series. The way the story started with the Dead Men Assembling and that classic Skulduggery ripoff, the first half of the book was too enjoyable and the second was an all out war mostly having reveals that made me gasp, cry(as in shout loudly) and pass dreamy nights. Trust me when I say this, some epic stuff goes down here! First of all, the author deserves a never ending applause for dexterously managing the multitude cast of characters that he has created, pitching them in for a suitable plotline in the book and doing them so much justice that it all feels natural and bound to happen in the end. I mean, the character development in the series is over the top insane. The characters stay true to their original traits and seem very realistic. I liked the way Derek has brought in a POV narration of sorts with each character winding off on his/her own journey. To be honest, I didn't really dig into Scapegrace's and Thrasher's arc and I honestly don't know why th author has devoted 40-45 pages about these D-tier useless characters that don't seem to progress or push the story even in the smallest of bits. Anyways, this reading experience was a hands on delight and very much memorable. I never expected the reveals and the twists that came through midway and changed the entire game. I'm very much sure where the series to going for its end but after all there is only so much you can know and that too can't be guaranteed because we are talking about Mr. Derek Landy here and one chapter is all it takes to turn it all upside down and I have seen the final installment to contain over a hundred chapters, so there. I won't lie, reading a 700 paged book felt like a stretch to me compared to the classic 200 pages Skulduggery's and this is n an even smaller print so like I said some crazy stuff happens in the book and the story is too much to see over. I really like Chivari, China, Ghastly, Revel, the International Sanctuary and the whole ordeal about the war of the sanctuaries. Fletcher by far has the most developed secondary character arc in here. The Dead Men fighting together bought a new spirit to the series but we all know how that story ended, so let's just leave it there? Yeah, totally recommended for Skulduggery fans, just a suggestion. Take the story and the plot in slowly, don't you dare devour it. The book sets in some gradients and marks up for the final installment and may seem like a really long read because of the excessively fast paced plot but you'll get to the end eventually. I still can't believe it all ends in the next 700 pages. Damn. Definitely my favourite pick from the series so far! Nice Reading!",,,1,0

I did not expect it to take such a leap in such a shorter period. I can't believe there's just two books left for the original series to be over. Holy hell, things have really gone out of control in the series, especially the secondary characters flooding the pages it has become a chore to recall their names and personalities but thankfully the writing style simplifies this job that the reader has to unwillingly take. This book delivers like never before taking the action, dialogues and the imagination to a new heights. The author has worked wonders with twisting the plot into unbelievable events and it all making sense in the end, I really couldn't imagine that the book went down the path it went because by the end I was so shaken and regretful that I finished this book in two days. You need to cope up with the fast paced story and allow it to settle in instead of just binge reading 30 chapters in a go. This requires the reader to reflect and anticipate what's to come next but of course, Derek never delivers what's expected, what's the fun in that? The humor has been troded down upon a little but the action is way past soaring. The book could do without a few corny and cringy dialogues especially from Sanguine, Kitana and Scapegrace. I really loved where the story went and all the bizarre events happening all at once. Argiddeon's character brought a fresh appeal to the series, I really respect him as an antagonist and that sort of power had real rules. It also made me question the good guys a little bit. The whole sub-plot/arc about the discovery of Waldie, Argiddeon and his awakening made so much sense only to be shamed later by the sub-par Kitana and her degrading squad. i was never repulsed by an character from Skulduggery universe before, not even Serpine/Sanguine/Mevolent, she's just a bad bitch. The thing that they did with the parallel dimensions and meeting with the most terrifying enemies in a bleak situation and the way it ended with Valkyrie's reflection amazed me so much. Derek landy is so ingenious that he has somehow managed to gather all the myth, lore and the world building along with the enormous cast of characters and bind them together to deliver one epic blow which entirely changes the route which the series will be taking for it's end. the action scenes and the story is the true highlight of the book and I really can't stress how much eager I was to finish it all. The recurring characters do a pretty amazing job the council of elders and the Sanctuary itself has taken a higher place in the series and we'll be seeing the most powerful agents fight oof against each other in the upcoming installment. I really don't know what to expect anymore. This delivered way more than I could chew off and I regret reading it all so quickly. Many easter eggs, callbacks and plot developments that happened at a very rapid rate. The series is deeper than ever with much more characters and sub-plots than you'd expect. It had a philosophical edge to it with the brutality, violence and gore taken to a brand new level. Not suggested for younger Skulduggery fans. reread the first five books kids cause you might not like what's coming your way. The last page had my guts spilling over. We are the the great war now and the great war is dangerous. Derek Landy pays off yet again with a seemingly impossible delivery and an applaud deserving intricate plot.

As we all know the story has/had an insane narration pace, here it feels inconsistent mostly because of Valkyrie's unstable teenage romannce which takes up around 10% of the entirety of the book and thoroughly disappointing, not the bit with Fletcher but with Caelan and I'm really glad the author decided to give him a fancy death at the end of the book. There are a lot of elements that dictate the proceeding of the story along with multitude of character interactions we have never seen before like Kenny, the reporter, the street mugger, Dragonclaw, the necromancers, the Warlock (a race which we believed was extinct), the Twin Sisters of Havoc, Clarabelle, Nye, The League of Dead Men, Eliza Scorn, Melancholia (fancy name, character sucks), Craven, Wreath, The Sensitives, Lord Vile, Scapegrace and the Zombie Horde, Fletcher and the newly appointed Sanctuary leaders all play a noticeable if not major every single time role in the book. The way the plot moves is almost flawless with superb transitions and the author bides his time with character secrets and reveals them at a time creating the most impact. I almost do not have any complaints about the book as Mr Landy uplifts the readers to new heights with everything fresh with new depth and detail, a bit complicated but highly entertaining. I loved the reveal of Lord Vile's character being a subconscious of Skulduggery and the whole history lesson with regard to that. The League of the Dead Men introduced at the requiem Ball seems very fancy and may recur in further installments. Nye and Clarabelle working together? It can't get more weird! No Tanith/Billy-Ray Sanguine? A bit disappointing! Kenny, the reporter's takes on the Magical Community? Something's Fish! Valkyrie-Fletcher-Caelan love triangle? Sorry, I don't dig that. Let me talk about the necromancers in the book as the philosophical idea of 'Death Bringer' mostly relates to these outcast members of the society looking for the perfect person who can instantaneously kill 3B people for their salvation and permenance upon the Earth. The idea seemed  so enormous and fancy at first but I didn't imagine Solomon Wreath would aid them but the part played out very well. Melancholia's visual appeal was superb but  every single word coming out of her mouth, every line of dialogue seemed cheesy, corny and trivial like she did not really have an idealistic motive but a soiled adult with superpowers capable of destroying the entire magical community. Mostly, this had an intrisinic villainous roots with Eliza Scorn and Dragonclaw also kicking the protagonists a few times. Mostly, Lord Vile just swept his hands and the rest would be done by the shadows, that part totally engrossed me. A lot has been happening with Valkyrie's family, Alice, The Toxic Twins an the reveal that Fergus knows a bit of magic totally shocked me, it was so unexpected. The final battle between Lord Vile and Darquesse rose to epic heights than I'd expect. I'm very much excited for the future of the series, the author has thrown in some key plot points which may aid the story in the future installments. I thoroughly enjoyed this. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

The book opens with a nice action scene at the towers with Val fighting off Scapegrace. matter of fact, the book introduces at least 15 secondary characters out of which most are alive and I believe will play a vital role in the upcoming books. Most of the second grade villains are Scapegrace, Spingheeled Jack, Billy-Ray Sanguine with his signature killing weapon and Dusk. Of course, baron vengeous and the Grotesquery are the primary antagonists of the book but I think they are way too overpowered. The tier and the setup of the villainous heirarchy is built very adeptly by Mr. Landy. I really liked how the chapters were short and straightforward, the author goes to variety of depths to build the magical world of Baltimore and the Irish counties. I really loved the story of the book an how frequently the action occurs with humour supporting it and making the book quite entertaining. Many of the recurring characters are funny and intense as always with my personal favorite being China Sorrows, Tanith, Skul and Val. I did not the absence of Ghastly and I truly hope that he survives. The magical powers of Valkyrie have certainly developed and her character has a sense of evolution to it, she seems much more powerful and not so much naive as she once was. The book has many surprising events like the murder of the reflection, Lord Vile's armour, the rise of the grotesquery and the 'Edgley Family Reunion Thing' which complement each other and add to the story. The book is strongly  highlgihted by the individual villain of the story arc and the overshadowing series arc and both the minor and the major arc ebb into each other by the end and the hit that a bigger plan is in the works pays off very well. I do not have much complaints about the book except that the the Grotesquery is a bit too powerful and that would do us no good as there are nine more books to go and things may go downhill for the heroes. I also would have liked a but more background on vengeous, he is indeed a zealot and a formidable enemy. THe dynamics of relationship of China, Beryl, SKulduggery and the Torment certainly change with the arrival of Vengeous. Certainly action-packed, fast paced, unanticipateable storyline that gets the adrenaline pumping. A definitive page turner. Jumping to the Faceless Ones, in three, two, one. Nice Reading!",,,2,0

A mere delegation's seems to threaten out team. Derek has shown traces of turmoil and descent of the council of elders.<br/> Truly, dark days are coming.<br/> A dark read.<br/><br/>Skulduggery Pleasant Book 4<br/>*Dark Days* by Derek Landy<br/>I'm positively satisfied and glorified by where the series is heading and the great job it does by taking the readers with it on a very immersive journey. Dark Days opens up with a very tense and hostile atmosphere as Skulduggery is beyond the portal and Valkyrie has certainly matured, I like her bold and determined in the first half of the book, once she gets Skul-Man (As Finbar Wong says) back she gets a bit loose and shabby but still her character arc is the most notable. The amount of secondary characters (with their queer names) and the recurring characters along with the minor antagonists like Scapegrace, Jack, Sanguine, Crux and the now book antagonist Scarab might be daunting for new readers to the series. A lot goes down in the book and the character of Scarab might be the most realistic and practical villain in the entire series, he does feel wronged and sort of relatable but yeah, he's the bad guy. The plot deviates from the standard Skulduggery storyline with bits and pieces here and here but still miraculously maintaining consistency. It often frustrates me the amount of minor bad guys our heroic crew can't just execute who get away every time(the Revenger's Club) and also its very frustrating that  the Sanctuaries internal agents have never been loyal and cause massive deaths and destruction and the Sanctuary never backs up the good guys, it has to be the most underwhelming villainous force that has resulted in massive losses in the first four books. No security, no agents and no backup for the good guys. Fletcher Renn is truly marvellous in the book and helps save the day. It brings me relief that at least the worlds not ending in this one although it builds a up with multiple warnings and foreshadowing of Valkyries evolution into darkquesse and the end of the world in the near future. The story went in all unexpected places like China's secret revealed, zombie horde, Hotel Midnight!, the vampire's club(these guys are stealing the show really), Wreath's conspiracy about the Death Bringer, the Remnants Guild's backstory, the necromancers, the '3' prophecies, Val-Fletcher jam, etc. A lot of things happen in the book that got me all the way excited. Written very well with overall development of new enthralling characters. Professor Kenspeckle Grouse should be treated as a main character henceforth. The Revengers Guild and the weapons they forged will be memorable for sure. I really appreciate the element of the surprise that tbe book delivered at the ending. This book foreshadows a lot. The action scenes were perfect! At this point the readers should have realized that the Skulduggery Pleasant series is entire character driven and based on storybuilding. The humour was top notch as always kicking in a bit later after Skulduggery's return. I'd love to see Valkyrie and Skulduggery a expand on their magical abilities instead of just summoning a fireball every timr to burn up the Hollow Men. I'm absolutely loving this series and anticipating the future of all my favorite a characters. The future certainly looks bleak at this point of time. Jump in for scary depths, unexpected twists, humour, combat and excellent storytelling and of course, Magic! Nice Reading.",,,1,0

I mean, the story is wild and unleashed, the book introduces some formidable and memorable secondary characters which give the book a thrill.  Major character developments include Valkyrie, Skul, Ghastly(immense), Tanith, China, Solomon and the Sanctuary. I mean, it's really shocking, at least for me to see how much things have changed since the start of the book. By the time you reach the end you will be blown away by the shock and the surprise of it all, things are getting far worse. About the narration and writing, it is top-notch, better than all the previous book but to be honest it does not feel like a typical Skulduggery Pleasant novel, perhaps because the general lack of optimism and lustrous humor does not frequent the pages. Derek throws in some impressive quotes, lines, dialogues with the usual twists in the story as well as makes the secondary characters feel very important, I was very much involved and engrossed in the book, mostly for it's fast-paced action, unfaltering narration and of course, first class character evolution. 'Mortal Coil' takes the threat upto a more higher level with really powerful enemies the 'Remnants' possessing friends and foes alike of our friends. The book really does get pretty dark and gritty with all the violence and breakout in Ireland and major character deaths like Kenspeckle Grouse,  Sanctuary Leader. It is indeed shocking to see that almost half of the Sanctuary including the elders and leader have been changed twice through the book owing to the deaths of the predecessors. This was a wild ride for me, for real. I will never be able to perceive Skulduggery, Tanith and Valkyrie as I did in the previous books. All of these characters have become older and more serious than before and that really creeps me out. Shoutout to Tesseract, a primary antagonist in the book. I really respect his character, no personal vendettas and purely professional drives. He really went of out respectably in the final chapter.Tesseract will be one of the most memorable characters from the series but I wished he stayed for a book or two more. As the series is mostly plot and character driven it has really been difficult for me to review the writing style and which elements I like and don't like because I read not from the point of view of a reviewer/critic but a reader looking to devour the series ASAP thanks to the total insanity of the plot. It is notable that the book is a bit bigger than the earlier books. Also, the whole 'Death Bringer', 'Lord Vile' and 'Darkquesse' plot points are very much highlighted, especially after the first half and I really hate this, Mr. Landy reminds the readers of the dark fate(the apocalypse led by Val/Darkq) and how it is inevitable. I'm really sad for Tanith(cuz she's a Remnant now) and I get why Mr. Landy kept Sanguine and other minor vile's alive because of the role they'll play in shaping Darkquesse. The book introduced a lot about the past like the League of Dead Men, the binding of the Remnants, Gordon Edgly's life and habits and the world before the Great War which adds depth to the story and makes it way more interesting and surreal. I really like the Remnant plot and how it progressed, i was always o the edge of my seat to see who the Remnants would posses next and how it would all play out by the end and was anxious if my favorite characters would survive until the end. We even got a glimpse of Darkquesse and Lord Vile (jumping to next book as soon as I type this out). Seeing the Remnants posses a multitude of characters was really cool and the author described the whole event very well right from the beginning, the one mistake Wreath made and turned the whole Shebang into hazardous crises for Ireland.  I'm really anxious about the remainder of the series and look forward to enjoy the Skeleton detective and Valkyrie kick some serious ass without upsetting the power balance once again. i simply can't getting better than it is.

Elsewhere, some unknown for is rising. From dark caves to farm fallows this truly is an epic read.<br/>  Nice Reading!<br/><br/>Skulduggery PLeasant Book 3<br/>*The Faceless Ones* By Derek Landy<br/>What intrigues me the most is the plot of the book and where it takes he readers with it. The novel mostly has divided sub-plots and not so clear goals and a lot of POV's which strike just the perfect balance. At this point through the series, the magical world has grown a  lot and Mr. Landy has introduced at least 25 secondary characters and some of you might not be able to keep track of them all but I'm certain that even the least notable characters will play a vital role in the upcoming books in the series. I I really don't know how I feel about Fletcher Renn, I would say his character development is B-grade. Actually, the character development of all the secondary characters (including Wreath, Crux, Edgely's, Mr. Bliss) is B-grade as the author mostly focuses on the primary characters a lot and the depth to them is incomparable with the secondary characters. The plot took unexpected turns, as I said, this book took readers along new locations with the Farm, The Cave and the inter dimensional portal. I was thoroughly entertained with the quirky conversations, intense head on battles, the final conflict, introduction to new darker and much more powerful characters and the whole mission plan that SKulduggery lays out. The book had some crucial moments like Ghastly's (yeah, that guys back) mothers prophecy about Valkyrie's death, the return of the Faceless Ones, Gordon's Echo Stone and Solomon Wreath's proposal to Valkyrie, not to mention Stephanie's first kiss and the return of the White Cleaver, the death of Mr. Bliss (I still can't get over it!) I absolutely hate the third grade Remus Crux, I don't know if Mr. Landy designed him this way but I'm repulsed by that character. On the other hand China Sorrows has some background in the series and some scandalous secrets which I hope will be revealed soon. The cliffhanger left me heartbroken and in despair and felt a little fast. A lot of minor arcs play out in the story so this feels like a hurried joyride sometimes because the plot occasionally deviates from the primary storyline which breaks the monotony of the repetitive statement of the world being on the brink of extinction with the return of the Faceless Ones.  The secondary villains like Gruesome Krav, Blood Rose, Jaron Gallow were probably villains with the least character development and still a lot powerful, enough to overpower and injure Tanith Low Twice. Jeez! Even Scapegrace, Jack and Sanguine make an occasional appearance. Mr. Batu's identity reveal had me shocked and now ay didi I see that coming, certainly good. The story is mostly character driven and the amount of dialogues in this one feel a bit less as a darker threat looms over the world. The novel has intricacies linkin to the first two book and the set of the first three book certainly complement each other with each building towards the next. The ending left me gaping my mouth wide open. Valkyrie has certainly changed and evolved as a person, but she certainly hasn't reached the amazingly powerful tier yet. Fletcher is too dumb for a seventeen year old, Tanith has lost her combat ability to be frank, the story feels a bit rushed and going at multiple places (but i like it like that!) the villains are numerous and way too powerful, Mr. Bliss is dead, the Sanctuary is crumbling and the good guys need to get it together and save the world, I hope it summarizes most of the book. Absolutely enjoyed it, super easy to read through quickly. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

He is a child prodigy, who has dedicated his life to criminal activities. He leads the Fowl criminal empire, which has been established by his family for generations. After significant research, Artemis believes that he has confirmed the existence of fairies. He tracks down an alcoholic sprite posing as a healer in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and travels there with his bodyguard Butler to obtain from her The Book of the People—the Fairy holy book that is written in Gnommish.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Captain Holly Short of the Lower Elements Police is tracking a rogue troll that has managed to reach the surface of the Earth from Haven city, thousands of feet underground. Assisted by the technically mindedcentaur Foaly and LEPreconcommander Julius Root, she incapacitates the troll.<br/><br/>Artemis decodes the Book using translating software, and in the process, learns the specifics of the ritual fairies use to replenish their magic: take an acorn from an ancient oak tree near a bend in a river under the full moon and plant it elsewhere. Artemis and Butler track down 129 possible locations for the ritual and start a stakeout, they discover Holly performing the ritual. Butler tranquilizes Holly with a hypodermic dart gun.<br/><br/>A LEP retrieval team is sent to scout Fowl Manor. Using their 'shielding'ability, which allows them to vibrate faster than the human eye can follow, the team enters the manor grounds. Artemis had anticipated this, however, and installed a camera with a high frames-per-second rate, allowing him to detect the threat by freezing the image. After Butler incapacitates the intruders, Root decides to lay siege to Fowl Manor using a time-stop and enter negotiations. Artemis reveals the ransom demand: one metric ton of 24-carat gold. Artemis also reveals his knowledge of the time-stop and claims that he can escape it. An analysis by LEP behavior experts determines that Artemis is telling the truth.<br/><br/>The attempts to gain entry to the manor continue as the LEP recruit an infamous criminal, the kleptomaniac dwarf Mulch Diggums to break in. Fairies are forbidden from entering human dwellings without permission, but Mulch has forfeited the magic preventing him from entering dwellings, causing him to be safe when burglarizing. He tunnels underground to reach the house while Foaly feeds a loop to the manor surveillance system, allowing Mulch to freely explore. Mulch accidentally locates a safe containing Artemis' copy of the Book, finally revealing to the fairies the source of Artemis' knowledge, which he had led them to believe he had acquired from a truth serum administered to Holly. The Fairy Council, deciding that nothing is working, promotes a lieutenant calledBriar Cudgeon to Acting Commander, temporarily usurping Julius Root. Meanwhile, Holly Short cracks through the concrete of her cell, finding fresh dirt, and completes the ritual with a smuggled acorn. Having regained her magic, she escapes into the main house.<br/><br/>Cudgeon decides to release the troll Holly captured earlier into the mansion to force Artemis to allow the fairies to enter and subdue the troll. This backfires, as Butler, aided by Holly's healing powers, defeats the troll. The Fairy Council subsequently strips Cudgeon of his post.<br/><br/>Artemis is finally granted the ransom. The gold is sent in, and Artemis asks Holly for a wish: to cure his mother's insanity — she has been living in her bedroom, driven mad by the loss of her husband. Holly grants the wish at the cost of half the gold. The LEP decides to send in a 'blue rinse' – a biological bomb that kills all organic life — to eliminate Artemis and allow for the retrieval of the gold, but this fails when Artemis escapes the time-stop by drugging himself and his comrades withsleeping pills.<br/><br/>Having survived until the end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the remaining gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.<br/><br/><br/>Amazing!! I was well-acquainted with the Artemis Fowl series when I was young and tried to read it then but gave up as I was bored as soon as Holly Short was introduced, a couple of days ago when I attempted to start reading  the entire series successfully I hoped that I wouldn't give up. I realized that this book isn't really suitable for young kids. (You babies just keep reading Harry Potter and Geronimo Stilton), improve your vocabulary and comprehension and then start reading this. Generally, 13+ kids can start with the series. <br/>  The book is completely different from what you'd expect. It's about a 12 year old millionaire mafia boy named Artemis who is on a mission to earn back his lost family fortune. And he is witty and intelligent. Who'd think that he would mess up with a mythical species that would lead to  a cross-species war??<br/>  The most remarkable thing is that I learned 134 new words, that I previously didn't even read (Thanks to Kindles Vocabulary Builder feature).  Eoin Colfer has surely studied the English language and the art of writing.  There are a lot of new modern terms relating with technology, weaponry and emotional psychology that you will be seeing in here. The characters that Colfer has designed are praiseworthy and unique, emitting pure admiration and  original-ness. The characters are humorous, strong, witty, diplomatic, skilled, punny, funny and tactical. The story is not very long, but surely is a bit complicated and elaborate but not very lengthy. Each chapter is big enough to be read in half an hour. Also this book gives a lesson on how humans have degraded themselves and the nature. Colfer is a perfectionist and has researched and created powerful characters that make readers think about them and at the same time making them mysterious and insuspectable.  A lot of play of words and witty humour is seen all across the book which is trendy in today's modern age. Even in the most serious situation Colfer has a way to make you smile and laugh. The style of writing is casual but like a designed report. The plot moves steadily and at an even pace throughout the book. Sometimes, it becomes a bit lengthy in the most inappropriate places which is unnecessary. The weaponry, the fairy technology, the myths, Artemis' intelligence are the most remarkable part in the book. I would surely recommend this book to youngsters who have been reading intermediate books for 1-2 years. This is surely not beginners stuff. The ideas from the book are original and innovative. I'm surely going for the complete series. Nice Reading!!!",,,1,0

The informal, middle grade, humorous and fantastically unbelievable language makes Riordan's mythology adventure series on the top of my list. Having being read Percy Jackson and The Heroes of Olympus series I found this story to be predictable and fun at most times. In the Kane Chronicles we see (or hear, as it is a serialized broadcast) the journey of brother sister duo Carter and Sadie as they discovered their family and themselves are royal Pharaoh blood and connected to ancient Egyptian gods still existent in the modern world and a stirring creature of chaos that direly wants to escape and cause havoc in the world. Here's the official Synopsis:-<br/>Since their mother’s death, Carter and Sadie have become near-strangers. While Sadie has lived with her grandparents in London, her brother has traveled the world with their father, the brilliant Egyptologist, Dr. Julius Kane. One night, Dr. Kane brings the siblings together for a “research experiment” at the British Museum, where he hopes to set things right for his family. Instead, he unleashes the Egyptian god Set, who banishes him to oblivion and forces the children to flee for their lives. Soon, Sadie and Carter discover that the gods of Egypt are waking, and the worst of them—Set—has his sights on the Kanes. To stop him, the siblings embark on a dangerous journey across the globe—a quest that brings them ever closer to the truth about their family, and their links to a secret order that has existed since the time of the pharaohs.<br/>The book is very engaging with the readers and keeps the anticipation of the plot high at all times. Of course, it has a numerous twists, turns and surprises when you least expect them. There's a lot of 'hero' responsibility bestowed upon the children Carter and Sadie and their Quest to collect mythical artifacts and destroy Gods which makes the story terrific and incredible at the same time. This is 516 pages long so the plot is enormous, the pace of the story is moderate and very comfortable, at least for me. The book introduces a lot of characters over the time including humans, demigods, weird gods and goddesses with maniacal appearances and mocking names from Egypt and a good deal of hunters and magicians that play a key role in the narration. The locations shift consistently with the characters, mostly iconic, such as the pyramids of Giza, Washington DC, New York, Italy, The Underworld, The Gates of Hell, etc. Thanks to Mr. Riordan I was introduced to the Egyptian Gods, Myths, legends and artifacts which are remarkable as well and their depiction in the book deserves an applause. The story and the characters blend very well with the Egyptian setting in the book and the overall effect is very entertaining. The chapters have catchy names and Saddie's humorous and mocking narration speeds you through the book with ease. A lot of Egyptian terminologies have been put in, explained and experimented very well by the author. The emotional appeal of the Kane kids and their growing bond was a highlight in the book. The magical and fatal journey was a mastermind idea. There's a lot of shape shifting monsters, animal allies, Gods inhibiting heroes, a magical community, a budding romance and total chaos a the climax that delighted me. You just give this book a thorough read and you'll be astound. There's just way too much excitement, action, fantasy and humor in here. I'm very curious about the next book in the series as some new young heroes will be joining in the journey to face the snake demon Apophis. The Zia being a shabti twist was incredible, I was totally surprised about this  plot twist. I wish Carter and Sadie's parents were back from the dead at the end of the book but the cycle of rebirth and incarnation gives a deep message of the burden and maturity to the readers. Matter of fact, you ca actually see the growth of the characters right from the beginning to the climax, in terms of magic as well as maturity. These young children battle with gods such as Sekmet, Serquet, Set and their time limited quest served as a perfect weekend breakaway for me. The book does have mature theme about relationship, love, bond, sacrifice and growing pains but the overall picture is quite perfect. A very well-planned book with an ingenious beginning transitioning to epic ending full of Egyptian nostalgia, mythical creatures and artifacts, richly described locations and a wide cast of powerful characters makes it a perfect Riordan book. I'm so glad I picked this up. Will be starting, the Throne of Fire, the second book in the series today itself. This is gonna be a breakthrough journey. Very impressive. Nice Reading! ",,,1,0

A very handy, comfy and straightforward novel that questions the human emotions and how dramatically our words reflect the way we speak. Murder is Easy is one of Agatha Christie's most unique creation. The primary reason for this being that it is utterly impossible to predict or even guess the murder, it's somebody you'd never expect. As Poirot would say, 'I save the explanations for the last chapter.' is indeed true for this book. The plot is generic enough except the introduction, the traditional A.C narration follows with a lead ex-inspector and his lady love's first encounter which soon progresses to a suspense. The story is set in those Shire regions, so there's a bit of nature here and there. The principal characters are dramatic enough that they step out of the pages and actually act before us like a play performance. I really liked the way A.C plays mind games with the reader through the story and some novice readers may be fooled by this double crossing, or perhaps triple crossing too but even seasoned readers will not be able to comprehend the guilty. The story is consistent and the writing is meticulous. I shall say that it's not A.C's best novel but it's definitely entertaining and worthwhile to read. The end was simply surprising and fabulous but a bit too traditional. The bok length is quite short so no excessive blabbering. Nice Reading!",,,2,0

There's just oo uch to explore and read and in a way, the 'mysteries' of Agatha Chrisite are informative and provide insight and knowlegde relating to versatile fields. Endless night is a popular Aghata Christie novel that I picked up just a few days back suddenly and said, 'Lets give this a try.' What's entertaining and impressive about this book is that this is not actually a mystery or a suspense book either but something between a confessiona nd a psychological tale and nothing more. Of course, there are multiple factors which sideline the reader from the realities in the book and jumble them up. Any beginner/intermediate reader can rapidly read through the book as Chrisite has used the usual narration tone, simply on the outside but full of rich details and subtly laid out clues (Which you'll never guess). The stroy is veiled by curses and fate and a hint of superstition. The characters are minimal and the location mostly is Gypsies' Acre, a homeland of dark rumours. The story begins and progresses very well with simple and satisfactory introductions, key events, plot points occuring in a well laid out timeline. There'samost nothing philosophical spoken int he book but the dialogues are nonetheless entetaining due to sarcasm, hateful speech, curses and groundbreaking conversations. It seems rather ridiculious that Emily would just fall in love with Michael and secretly marry him and settle with him in Gypsies Acre, its a bit hard to believe but the author has her own reasons which are well provided for. Now, the real fun begins once you come to know all about the relationships, the families and who's who. It's all just a big trick to mislead you so you won't see what's coming. So the story actually captures your full attention after Emily's and Catherine's death. As I said, this is not actually a suspense or mystery novel but something of a criminal's autobiography where she/he explains all the events happening. Greta is a key character to look out for. Then, the story moves quiter rapidly and the scheme, conspiracy, scandal (call it whatever you may) is uncovered and the truth saddens and shocks you like never before. All the clues form the introduction and the first half of the sotry fit in and the tale heightens and reaches its zenith. Agatha Chrisite as created sucha  wonderful masterpiece that amazed me and shook my, nothing is as it appears. In fact, Christie is a sly and a witty writer. Her addition of the song ""Some Are Born To Sweet Delight. Some Are Born To Endless Night'' worked magic witht he story as it added some icing on the cake and impressed me by fitting suitably within the storyline. A psychological insight, a surprising novel, one of Christie's best works. And there's a whole lot of money business, inquests, scandals, fortune telling, accidents, families and hidden motives so look out for all of these. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

It was unique in some aspects while in others it was usual. Sparkling Cyanide is divided into three parts:- A. Character Introductions. B. Events occurring on All souls' day C. Iris' Book. I completely enjoyed the character POV's in the first part of the book where we get around 20 pages of unique character point of view narrations and how Iris, George, The Farradays, Anthony Browne and Ruth Lessing feel about Rosemary's death. Actually the events which led to Rosemary's death are what influence the story and characters throughout the book and a few hints and clues associated with George's murder are noticeable there. The first part of the book give an insight to the above mentioned characters and their personality which prepares the stage for the story where each of these will be prime suspects. Also a strong hint of motive is also attached to each of these characters which leads them to become prime suspects in the readers mind. Agatha Christie through the characters and the story interacts with the readers. I've always adored her portrayal of 'English'/ 'British' lifestyle and the orthodox men and ladies in each of her stories. I found the culture, attitude, lifestyle and linguistics of these characters extremely interesting. There's an underlying feeling of darkness, grimness throughout the book because at no point can one decide whether Rosemary's death was a murder or a suicide. The evidence for the crime is discovered much later in the book when it approaches the climax but you'll come across hints and clues midway. Christie's prime objective is that the readers should never underwhelm any characters in the book. Each and every single characters has some or the other role in the story, never ignore even the smallest of the characters, regardless of their personality. Now, the story becomes quite interesting as the actual events begin to happen and the story takes a sudden twist in the second part of the book on All Souls' Day, which leads to some paranormal activity suspection. Christie is craftful, intuitive and ingenious. She links all the events and characters to bring about a grand climax and a boggling yet rational explanation. The book also features yet another appearance of Colonel Race and his subordinate inspectors who join the case. I found The Stephen/Alexandra Farraday Arc and their backstory very interesting and how it influences the crime. The final explanation was simple yet nobody could have thought about it. Anthony Brown and Iris Marle were my favorite characters throughout the book. In fact, the story heavily leans upon romance as a theme. Romance, envy, hatred and money are the primary motives for multiple murders. The genius act of turning murders into suicides amused me the most. Like always, the story ends with the lovers proposing marriage to each other and a happy ending. (This is the classic Agatha Christie ending). If you're a Christie Classic Novel fan, this book deserves your reading time immediately. A seemingly complicated enjoyable reading experience. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

Not only it's historical, but it doesn't take place in English nations but in Ancient Egypt. Forever, like other novels, the first murder occurs halfway through the book and the initial setup covers the first half of the book. There's no detectives, bounty hunters, police in the story nor any modern amenities which makes the narration completely different. The much detailed author notes and foreword which is unprecedented to any other Christie novels show us how seriously this book should be treated. Now, for my personal opinion, this was a delightful read. Nearly perfect, dramatic, thrilling story which takes you away from the regular A.C. Classic novels and transports you to an ancient world where you come across Egyptian/Greek culture, traditions and styles of murder. For the sake of better understanding and timeline, the book is divided into Egyptian seasons and harvesting months that will help you keep a track of time. Now, the actual story is quite straightforward, restricted to a small location with a handful number of major characters and key plotlines. What I most enjoyed about the book is the portrayal of human nature, human psychology and natural beauty. Amateur Psychologists should definitely read this book for knowledge as well as entertainment. The book depicts human nature, drama, behavior and response,etc, etc. The book also strongly hints how women (no offense) can sometimes be extremely irritating. The serene and lucid description of Egyptian land captivated me. The primary characters are well developed. You never know where the story heads. I think Nofret, an antagonist figure was one of A.C's best creation yet. Beware, there's a whole lot of poisoning, mild language, throwing people off the cliffs, hatred and hateful language throughout the book. I really loved how the characters interacted. A.C laid out many clues through the pages which helped me to suspect the medieval murderer. In fact, you can never anticipate what's gonna happen next. Also, A.C. purposely leaves out some hoaxes to confuse you and suspect a characters who gets murdered within moments. The simple and lucid narration and the thrilling storyline brought the story to life and helped me read it very rapidly with immense comprehension. It even tells you about power, influence, differences between men and women, etc. etc. Definitely pick up this A.C gem. The book has a whole lot of rational insight, balances of probabilities and whatnot. The characters such as Nofret, Esa, Renisenb, Hori portray a unique aspect of humanity and how it influences others. A first class book that deserves rereading.  The font style and the appearance of the book is simply beautiful. There are dialogues uttered by characters which I've highlighted, philosophical dialogues that teach you a hell of a lesson. Do watch out for these. It's surprising how I can't convey what I actually feel about the book. It has densely packed with chills, thrills and even a few supernatural appearances that will engross you to medieval Egypt. Nice Reading. :D",,,1,0

It's one of the most puzzling, Unexpected, surprising, revealing mysteries written by Agtha Christ ever. Though, it's a great suspense story, there's not much happening throughout the book, no particular/special events and just deduction, investigation, interrogation, flashbacks and whatnot? So, there the book loses some of its enchantment. Now, the story is pretty simple to follow and the past is the key to the represent,so it's essentially to consider the past events while reading each and every part of the book. As usual, Christie has put in a lot of clues for the readers in each of the chapters but you just can't figure out who the murderer is, not until the last ten pages when the bigger picture comes together and all the facts connect with each other. The location, the premise, the events were not at all entertaining and I just dragged on reading. But what I love the most about this book are it's splendid characters, each has a different perspective towards the situation, a different story to tell, each somewhat rueful and guilty for their vices. The family politics is seen throughout the book. In fact, it's a family drama story with an evident amount of tendon and'darkness' hanging around (you'll come to know why when you read it). There's just way too much of fear, suspicion and guilty experienced by all the characters which adds up the puzzlement of the reader and makes it difficult to Target a single identity. Through the story a load of philosophical ideas are portrayed and I really enjoyed these parts of the novel, each teaching us a simple lesson for our betterment. The sorry is steady and laid out very well. If there was some action, adventure, event character interaction this book would be a hit. The most unexpected and surprising explanation is provided which will strike you hard. The writing Tyler and the tension in the family is described very well. I particularly like Arthur's characters and the past life of Rachel. A fantastic story that lacks adventure, though readable. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

I'm so glad that the book didn't feature any inspectors, detectives or police officers though we have a fair share of doctors, solicitors and lawyers (like in most Agatha Christie novels). I really cherished and enjoyed the company of Bobby and Frankie. These two amateur sleuths try to deduce, follow and discover the secret and unravel the murder mystery. The book is quite simple with related characters which are easy to follow and trace. But the trouble begins when you come to understand that each of these characters have at least a couple of Aliases and Pseudonyms or something of that kind and then it becomes really hard to know who's who. But still, for me this was a pleasurable read. If you look at the bigger picture, it would have taken Christie a considerable time to plot out the story and interconnect it with the characters because this is a superb and a genius piece of writing. I also love the few action scenes we get, locations, fun-loving yet prudent protagonists, cheerful dialogues and the grim haunting of the murderer. The interconnected murder mystery goes deep down. I adore how the story goes back in time and connected with the past death of John Savage and the great conspiracy which led to the present events. Overall, the story is ideal for amateur readers above the age of 13. The ending was perfect, no doubt there. You'll be shocked by understanding how much your favorite characters have changed from the first page to the last page. The personal problems of each of these characters and their perception towards life is also highlighted mildly in the book. Surely recommended to all mystery readers. Though don't expect Sherlock Holmes Class Deduction. Our protagonists are just young curious cheerful people who would like to get the cat out of the hat. That's all! Nice Reading!  ",,,1,0

The book portrayed the locations, climate, weather and the overall mapping very well, I also agree that the major characters deserve a strong applaud but the character cast was just way to big, unnecessary and boggling. I was bewitched with the story by reading the first few chapters but then once the main event was done the story was dragged on and on (in the end you come to know that those 15  character interviews and 150 pages are completely obsolete and unnecessary) but still it provides a deeper insight into the life of the multitude of characters present in the book. I would surely not recommend this book to beginner suspense reader. I particularly like the beginning and the ending of the book and thoroughly enjoyed Emily's ingenious and pragmatical outlook towards the case and her cause to do so. The writing style was simple and mediocre. There will be some moments in the book which will feel monotonous but just keep reading. And, of course, you can never predict the criminal 'till the end (Just like all Christie books) but when you do you will be shocked and amazed at the same time. I love the way how all the characters interact with each other, how the story joins together and gives the reader a bigger and a seemingly complex picture that's just incredible.  The book is highlighted by various strongly felt emotions, a lot of drama, melodrama. (Which is fine cause 50% characters include women) I mildly entertaining book which gives a strong message. I love the way how the atmosphere is created and the reader is magically transported to the icy hamlet of Sittaford/Hazelmoor/Extinton! Nice Reading!  ",,,1,0

I think the in-book dialogue “A murder is the culmination of a lot of different circumstances, all converging at a given moment at a given point.” states in a nutshell what the books about and to tell the truth, this book, in fact, was completely different. Christie doesn’t bore the readers with something repetitive and copied, there’s always a sense of reading original, rational and reinvented work and this was certainly highlighted in the novel. Of course, the plot was mastered very well, look at it-simple, straightforward and witty, observe it- deep, interconnected, logical, practical, pragmatical and positively entertaining. The idea was quite ingenious and unorthodox in a sense. Right from the beginning all the events and the characters fall into line, progressing as per as the authors standard and the story’s necessity to bring about the thrilling and potentially believable climax. The characters in the book were equally balanced and I suspected almost everybody. I loved the way Agatha portrayed the major characters and their participation in the story early hand in the first few chapters by giving a short incident in their private lives and how it affected the story as a whole. Undoubtedly, there’s a lot to learn from the book. The story twists and turns and the characters are all equally suspectable, yet you won’t see what’s coming at you in the end. Though, I have to agree that the conclusion of the story was very satisfactory and joyful. The novel is a short quick read and takes a couple of days, not more than that. Agatha Christie takes into consideration every single detail to make sure that the readers stay entertained and the story seems real and practically possible. This novel also features Superintendent Battle, one of my favorite characters in the story and he definitely adds some value to the storyline and action. There’s not much action, humor, adventure or nature depicted but the atmosphere created while writing the story is very apt and suitable. The moods and emotions of characters and narrated in a subtle and careful manner which compliment the storyline. As a reader, I was amazed, thriller and thoroughly entertained with the twist and turns in the story. A great read for beginners and advanced readers alike. Recommended to all. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

The <br/><br/>Story of Mr. Sattlewithe and Mr. Harley Quin is surely an entertaining one but what's more notable is that it adds a very different perspective to narration and storytelling. New layers, new perspective, a <br/><br/>new dimension if you will. The book contains short stories- some are mundane, some surreal while some thrilling and exciting. Of course, suspense is the central theme but if you read carefully you will <br/><br/>find numerous other traces of themes. The book plays with the readers emotions and helps the readers anticipates future events. I truly liked Mr. Quin's personality paired with Mr. S's nature and logical <br/><br/>thought process, it's a strangely surprising duo that nails every mystery gradually but thoroughly. Each short story is a different adventure on its own, though I found the conditions of these stories vaguely <br/><br/>similar to each other. Christie has put in a remarkable amount of effort in writing this book and has depicted the nature, atmosphere and appearances of characters that chronologically appear an recur in <br/><br/>the book. The book fails to grab your attention at times and may seem less interesting at times, just keep reading and you'll be delighted with the virtually impossible and impractical yet convincing <br/><br/>conspiracies, secrets, murders and suicides.

I'm amazed. The primary thing that comes to my mind after reading this is how much effort Christie has put into writing her books. Indeed, precise calculations, speculations, plot development has undoubtedly been considered while writing this book. On terms of length, this book is average - 330 pages, a short read. (Took me 3 Days) but each page delivers excellent content to the readers with a wide cast of characters, I mean truly a varied cast of multitude characters which may boggle your brain if you are a beginner mystery reader. The book deserves your focused attention. Now, moving to the story, it's fast paced, has an air of mystery and suspense to it and thoroughly entertaining mostly due to humorous and light-hearted protagonists such as Superintendent Battle, Victoria, Anthony Cades etc. Right from the beginning the reader jumps up into a 'classical detective story' I would say, it had a lot of Sherlock Holmes atmosphere to it but I wouldn't compare the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to Agatha Christie's. Now, as the story progresses the riddle and the questions that seem to daze the readers untangle slowly, sometimes simplifying matters while sometimes making them more intricate and this keeps the reader wanting more. The book also depicts a variety of characters each having a unique desirable skill. Not just that but the book fashions and highlights a lot of culture, history, royalty, sociology, crime and foreign language so you get to know about mixed bags facts now and then. I would proudly say that this book enabled me to learn nearly a 100-150 words so better read it on your e-reader or keep a dictionary handy. What's the spotlight of the book is how the intricate plot, a multitude of characters and chronologically happening events which are seemingly a question complement each other and this suspense builds up at the climax and is answered in the least expected manner crediting to a load of surprises for the reader. I loved the protagonists of the book. In fact, I even loved the geographical representation of the Chimneys and the outlying parts. The author endeavors to connect the plot with history, crime and royalty and make it intense. If you think that the book just includes a <br/>murder, a 100M $ Diamond, car chases, gunfights, mysterious shadows and secret alleys you are into much more than you just see. The author convinces the readers that almost seemingly impossible events can occur much easily if things are done in time and is practically very correct. For me, the book has been a great treat. I'm hooked to Christie's works. The chapters are broken down with fantastic titles and  a short surprise/cliffhanger at the end. Funny, Humorous, Entertaining, Full of Action, Connecting Plot and Thrills. Recommended to Intermediate Readers. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

I would say this is a near perfect novel that delivers entertaining content and a mesmerizing storyline but but the readers point of view I wouldn't state this book as Christie's best. But the fact that it's totally worth reading should be left aside. Readers can relate the story symmetrical here and there with 'An Ordeal by Innocence's by the same author where a sudden murder occurs and everybody in the family is tensed as they suspect the murderer is one of them resulting in complete breakdown and psychological effects on family members. This book is roughly very much same. The primary characters, namely Charles and Sofia work together throughout the book but I won't say they're the best detectives, they are just clever and prudent, the credit should be given to the occurring events which unveils mysteries and simplifies matters. The characters are limited, the story is straightforward without much twists and you can see the climax approaching very early. Right form the beginning, the author delivers simple facts of who, what and where. The events that occur simply carry on and entertain the readers. I really liked the Crooked House and the Leonidas Family. Each and every member has a minor motive to murder Elder Leonidas and their behaviour is so different from each other. It may take you a. while to get what Christie is trying to convince but if you do that early, you are in for a rich and deep narration. Once thing about all Agatha Christie classic novels is that there's a much deeper meaning, scattered clues for the readers through the page, links that join each other which, to the readers may appear simple but are truly complicated for the author to transform into a story, so Christie deserves an applaud for her planned crime. The conclusion to the story will shake you, definitely. The book gives you a strong reason to suspect each and every characters by giving you a hint of their flaws and delivers the final thrill. I read this one in paperback (new edition) so the font, letters and page setting was quite impressive. The book is really handy. The story has a lot in it about emotions and family bonding along with filial generations and intricate relationships. There's not much action or change of location but the fast-paced thrilling narration will definitely entertain you. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

Greatness is not on my part for reading the book within a day, the greatness is about Agatha Christie who has written such an incredible and mind-blowing story. Simply perfect, there's no argument. Now, the story, characters, premise, theme, locations, etc. were just complimentary to each other and added a 'posh' texture to the story. I mean, right from the first page, when you know that the author has written the foreword stating  that this is her work of her lifetime, you know that you're in something bigger, something larger, sometime so dexterous and magnificent that the book deserves your entire attention and as the plot unrolls you dive in deeper and deeper into the fictional world. Not just the ten-character narration but almost everything from the book was unique, original and ingenious. The plot was crafted with much care, thought and efforts, about this I have no doubt. I would also like to state that this mystery/suspense/murder mania (call it whatever you want, in the end it won't fit into any of these themes) is far different from Christie's other works. This book is a definite page-turner, of course, I will urge you to read this as quickly as you can. Wanna start binge reading Agatha? This should be your first choice. All details are crystal clear, the story is so easy to follow- it may seem intricate and complex with ten major character (who fall dead like flies) introduced right at the beginning of book but just read the first chapter twice over and you are good to fly through the words. I really love how the story flows, steady, yet delivering and catering to all the needs of the reader keep him/her always on the edge of the seat. This book has a lot to account for, surely worth reading a couple of times over to grab the details left out in the initial read. The characters are feel emotionally very real, their conditions, habits, personalities strike right into the readers heart. Many questions are put forward in front of the readers and answered slowly yet crystal clearly in a ration and thorough manner. Each and every situation is taken into consideration and simplified for the readers, although this happens in the background. Also, the story is unpredictable yet very practical and seemingly true. An unexpected set of events kicks off and keeps thrilling the readers. I really felt connected to the story. And OH MY GOD! The revelation at the ending is the essence of the whole book. The novel has a lot of psychological analysis and emotional tumult taking place within it. A story to devour, cherish, fear, enjoy and delight. Nice Reading!   ",,,1,0

Let me be honest, this was not like the usual classic mysteries and e role of Miss Marple as a protagonist is evident throughout although we see only 25% of her appearance in the book. It strikes me as a surprise to see that the POV narration wasn't by Miss Marple but the vicar whose relation to the actual murder was negligible. The characters were minimal and the story straight but I have to admit that the ending blew me away, I mean I always had the idea in my subconscious that something like this was bound to happen and in fact was an amazing plan for the murderer to escape conviction and it really gave me the realization of my dreams. Christie's writing is top notch as always, it induces and teleports the reader in the 19th/20th century English towns with a typical (not always) set of characters and women of class always having some involvement in the mystery. I speed through the book at places and found myself a bit devoid of the plot points and I really regret that. I acknowledge Christie's writing skills and natural human dialogues and verbal exchanges which really strike me as realistic and of a linguistically superior order. I couldn't help but laugh at some of the between the lines dialogues as we have a rather interesting cast of characters. It really was fun to see the reaction of the secondary characters and their take on the the murderers identity.  The revelation at the end was glorious and epic in all it's sense. I look forward to a whole summer Christie experience. Nice Reading.",,,2,0

Agatha does write with spirit and liveliness. I was a bit hesitant to start with Christie collection due to the enormous number of books included in it though now I'm going to devour pages rapidly and earn the 'Eternal Fan of Mystery Queen' badge for myself. I can't compare this book or give a verdict whether its good or bad as compared against other works by Christie at this moment. Here goes. The book fashions a wonderful and immersive storyline, a multitude of characters, mostly suspects and acquaintances, coupled with the narration style this is unprecedented to any other form of writing I've ever read. I came to know what the craze was all about. The book kicks off with a very entertaining start, progressing swiftly, introducing new characters, developing the characters as well as adding layers to the storyline. I have to say that the plot includes an adventuress, guns, cruises, cakes, frocks, murder, manors, African tours, beaches, ports <br/>and cheerful primary character-Anne. Everything about Anne is delightful, a very memorable character crafted as such as to suit the storyline and add an air of peacefulness and joy to disastrous situations. If you think this is just a mystery, action, adventure story you will definitely be proved wrong as there's a noticeable romance in the air. Now, the writing style is very simple but the story may seem a bit intricate to amateur readers. I really liked the ingenious characters of Harry, Sir Eustice, etc. I read the entire book withing 48 hours, the mysterious situations hang in the air and as you progress through the chapters the mystery unfolds slowly and steadily to help the reader dive deeper. The end was very much satisfying, I can't picture anything better. There's well-meant humor, high vocabulary, rich depiction of  nature, surrounding, multiple continents. (though not in GRRM's annoying style) The author does not bore the readers with unnecessary details yet is successful in creating a complex and mind boggling mystery and suspense. The characters blend in with the story. The dual narration of Anne as well as Eustice was complimentary. Multiple side-stories and special character appearances highlight the nature of the plot. I'll surely continue with a whole lot of other Chrisite books. Nice Reading. Suitable for all ages. <br/><br/>Take a glimpse of the storyline and character list.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>Orphan Anne Beddingfeld, in search of adventure, follows the clue in a note from the pocket of a murder victim. Her journey takes her on an ocean <br/><br/>voyage from London to Africa, and finally to a lost island, on the trail of stolen diamonds. Nadina, a ""Russian"" dancer, receives a visit in her dressing room from Count Sergius Paulovitch. Both are in the service of a man they call ""the Colonel"", an international agent provocateur and criminal. After <br/><br/>many years, ""the Colonel"" is retiring, leaving his agents high and dry. Nadina has double-crossed the Colonel, however, keeping some De Beers <br/><br/>diamonds from a crime years before. She now plans to blackmail the Colonel with the diamonds.<br/><br/>Anne, longing for adventure, jumps at the chance offered by her father's solicitor to live with him and his wife in London. Returning from an <br/><br/>unsuccessful job interview, Anne is on the platform at Hyde Park Corner tube station when a man falls onto the live track, dying instantly. A doctor <br/><br/>examines the man, pronounces him dead, and leaves, dropping a note on his way. Anne picks up the note, which reads ""17.1 22 Kilmorden Castle"". The <br/><br/>inquest on the dead man, ""L B Carton"", brings a verdict of accidental death. In his pocket was a house agent's order to view a house for let – The Mill <br/><br/>House in Marlow – and the next day the newspapers report that a dead woman has been found there, strangled. The house is owned by Sir Eustace <br/><br/>Pedler MP. A young man in a brown suit is identified as a suspect, having entered the house soon after the dead woman.<br/><br/>Anne realises the 'doctor' did not examine the dead man in an appropriate manner, and becomes suspicious. After fruitless investigations at Mill <br/><br/>House, where she finds an undeveloped canister of film, Anne discovers that Kilmorden Castle is the name of a ship sailing on 17 January 1922 from <br/><br/>Southampton to Cape Town. She books passage on it. On board the ship, Anne meets Suzanne Blair, Colonel Race, and Sir Eustace Pedler himself. In <br/><br/>addition to his normal secretary, Guy Pagett, he has employed a man who goes by the name of Harry Rayburn. At 1:00 am on the morning of the <br/><br/>22nd, a young man staggers into Anne's cabin having been stabbed. Anne is able to dress the man's slight wound but the man is not in the least bit <br/><br/>grateful and leaves after an altercation with her.<br/><br/>One evening on the ship, Colonel Race recounts the story of the theft of a hundred thousand pounds' worth of diamonds some years before, <br/><br/>supposedly by the son of a South African gold magnate, John Eardsley, and his friend Harry Lucas. John and his friend were arrested but John's <br/><br/>father, Sir Laurence, disowned his son. John Eardsley was killed in the war and his father's huge fortune passed to his next of kin. Lucas was posted as <br/><br/>""missing in action"". Harry Rayburn walks into the cabin as the story is being told, overhears it, looks sick, and leaves. Race reveals that he himself is the <br/><br/>fortunate next of kin.<br/><br/>Anne confides in Suzanne and they examine the piece of paper Anne obtained in the Underground station. They realise that the paper could refer to <br/><br/>cabin 71 – Suzanne's cabin, originally booked by a Mrs Grey, a pseudonym for Nadina. Anne and Suzanne speculate that Nadina was the dead woman <br/><br/>in the Mill House. Anne suddenly connects finding the film roll in Mill House with a canister of film that was dropped into Suzanne's cabin on the <br/><br/>night of the 22nd. They look inside the canister and find uncut diamonds. They speculate that Harry Rayburn is the ""Man in the Brown Suit"". Anne is <br/><br/>attacked as she walks the deck of the ship; Harry Rayburn saves her. Anne amazes Harry with her knowledge of events in Marlow and at Hyde Park <br/><br/>Corner station, and suggests that Harry may be Harry Lucas and the ""Man in the Brown Suit"". They again part on bad terms.<br/><br/>Once they arrive in Cape Town, Anne is lured to a house at Muizenberg, where she is imprisoned in the attic by a bearded Dutchman. Anne overhears <br/><br/>another person she met on board the Kilmorden Castle, the Rev. Chichester, speaking with the Dutchman about ""the Colonel"" wanting to question her <br/><br/>tomorrow. The next day she escapes and makes her way back to Cape Town. There she finds that Harry is wanted as the ""Man in the Brown Suit"" but <br/><br/>has gone missing. Pedler offers Anne the role of his secretary on his continuing trip to Rhodesia; she accepts at the last second, and is reunited on the <br/><br/>train with Race, Suzanne, and Pedler, who has another new secretary named Miss Pettigrew.<br/><br/>In Bulawayo, Anne receives a note from Harry which lures her out to a ravine near their hotel. There she is chased and falls into the ravine. Almost a <br/><br/>month later, Anne awakens in a hut on an island in the Zambezi with Harry Rayburn, who rescued her. He reveals that someone deliberately caused <br/><br/>her to fall. Anne and Harry fall in love. Harry tells her of the diamond discovery he and John Eardsley made years earlier. They were duped by a young <br/><br/>woman called Anita Grünberg, who substituted their diamonds for ones stolen from De Beers. After being listed as missing in action, Harry <br/><br/>disappeared, coming to Africa under the name of Harry Rayburn.<br/><br/>Some time later he came across a man – Carton – and recognised him from the incident with Anita Grünberg. Carton is revealed to be the man who <br/><br/>fell in the Tube station and dropped the note Anne found. Harry followed Carton to London and Nadina to the Mill House, but insists Nadina was <br/><br/>already dead. He realised that the diamonds were probably still on the Kilmorden Castle. Anne confirms that they were, and were handed to Suzanne <br/><br/>in her cabin on the night of the 22nd. Harry's island is attacked that night by a party led by the red-bearded Dutchman, but the two manage to escape, <br/><br/>and Anne plans to return to Pedler's party where she can keep an eye on developments. They exchange codes to be used in future communications so <br/><br/>that neither can be duped again. Reunited with Suzanne, Anne is told that the diamonds are with luggage sent on with Sir Eustace. She also receives a <br/><br/>telegram from Harry telling her to meet him.<br/><br/>Anne goes to the meeting with Harry and again bumps into Chichester, alias Miss Pettigrew. She is led to Sir Eustace, alias ""the Colonel"". Pedler forces <br/><br/>Anne to write a note to Harry to lure him to his office, which she does, but she does not include their code in it. Harry turns up and Pedler is exultant <br/><br/>– until Anne pulls out a pistol and they capture Pedler. Race turns up with reinforcements and Pedler tries to bluff matters out, but is unsuccessful. Sir <br/><br/>Eustace manages to escape. Anne is somewhat pleased, having developed a fondness for him. Race tells her that Harry is in fact John Eardsley, not <br/><br/>Harry Lucas, and therefore the heir to the fortune.

It was particularly amusing, with dumb and stupid characters and jokes, size changing potions, card monarchs, pandemonium situations and a girls innocent curiosity and especially, the personification of all the living organisms. The story is so very simple and straightforward it just couldn't get any simpler. A good book but sometimes very boring, especially the rhymes and poems and I strongly suggest it to people below 11. You will certainly find it interesting. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

Nothing very complex or difficult yo understand at all. I'm very surprised that it got over so quickly. The cha each gets retain their original qualities viz. Watson's Inquisitiveness and Sherlocks Witty deduction, Logical Thinking and minute observation. The King Aka the Bohemian client is also a good and remarkable character. The book focuses on Irene Adler, as could have been a better antagonist surely, but Doyle made it clear that it was not to be. The story got better as it progressed with each page. The on sets to on of the room, the street chaos and the discovery of Tr photograph was what I liked about the story. One thing that ticked me off was that Holmes went on a quest (a case) which did not needed to be solved. Irene, in the end did not have any evil motive. (Or was it because Sherlock discovered the photograph).<br/>Anyways, Nice Reading.<br/>*The Red Headed League*<br/>Another short story from the Sherlock Holmes Universe. The beginning seemed very interesting and gripping. The case itself seemed complex, difficult to solve and very much peculiar. But it was easy to comprehend and react to (At least for Sherlock Holmes) the characters continued to retain their traits. The red headed conspiracy was just great with the motive to to loot the bank but tho tell the truth the ending doesn't really match. Something more darker and grim was expected. There's a lot of characters, half of them working as an alias. (So read carefully). An interesting beginning with an ""okay"" ending along with impressive ploy and not much science of deduction to see here but mere observation.<br/>*A case of identity*<br/>Thus is a quite different, and a very unique story. Somewhat interesting. Its very shirt with not much action . This time, Holmes solves the case by just sitting in his home at Baker Street in 2 days only with the help of few deductions and probabilities. Not a very notable case but something which stands exceptional and different from other prominent cases.  A short and sweet adventure. Never suspected the conclusion to be like it is.<br/>*The Boscombe Valley Mystery*<br/>Probably the most notable and interesting story in The book. The ending was really old with the back story of Mr. Turner and his crimes. Happy endings ate always cheerful. Holmes has preserved his ingeniousness and cracks the case with a lot of deduction  in a scientific manner. The plot in the beginning is smooth and follows a steady pace. In the interlude, its very easy to point at the culprit, thanks to the limited characters. A fantastic, notable, memorable, remarkable and truly adventurous read. Characters are humane, genuine and unique. <br/>*Five Orange Pips*<br/>An odd case. The beginning was easily understood but the end I could not comprehend at all. Its too confusing and Disconnects from the central plot. Not recommended. 0/5 You could Do better @ArthurDoyle.<br/>*Man With the Twisted Lip*<br/>A Major disappointment<br/>*Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle*<br/>A very well planned and nicely written story conveying every possible detail so that the reader is hooked. The case, thankfully, inst too much complex for comprehension. The language is almost lucid. It is interesting in a strange way to see the goose as a central storyline. Sometimes, the plot was too obvious and sometimes not at all.<br/>*Adventure of the Speckled Band*<br/>The begin not and the introduction was exceptional and probably the best in the book. The plot was exciting with some action and violence. The end was not very satisfactory. Should have been much more darker and somewhat homicidal. An intricate mystery was what I craved for.<br/>*Adventure of the Engineers Thumb*<br/>Rather than saying that this was a case I would say that it was a retelling of an unfortunate event, which makes it stand apart from other stories from this book. It was a professional retelling of a terrorist group. The tracking methods of Sherlock Holmes are highlighted. The most ""Trivia"" point I found in the book was that the client/ engineer does not approach Sherlock directly, like other clients do, but is referred by Watson to Sherlock. Nothing special. And there's only just a faint hint of Science of Deduction. <br/>*Adventure of The Noble Bachelor*<br/>It was a nice experience yo read such a story. This sort of cases are rare. It was bit much of a mystery but it was solved carefully, thanks to the Probability and deduction abilities of Mr. Holmes. It was somewhat predictable but also enjoyable.<br/>*Adventure of The Beryl Coronet.*<br/>I vaguely remember that I had read the same story in a children's classical retelling of Sherlock Holmes. The character of the banker is remarkable. It is sad to see him desperate, weary and tired due to his huge responsibility. It tells us the moral that appearances are deceptive. Holmes has continued to shoe his brilliance and its wonderful to see him solved 70% of case by just studying footprints on ice. A memorable read.<br/>*Adventure of the Copper Beaches*<br/>Very impressive. The retelling of the queer and strange events by miss Hunter was the most prominent and novel event in the book. Its somewhat haunting and be spooking to hear an event like this. Sherlock Holmes cracks the case this time not by his deduction but simple logic that anybody could apply. But still a very adventurous story.",,,1,0

The manga is seriously a total hit with brand new characters and their journey in the Kanto region.   This Manga arc shows the journey of Red, his rival Blue and a Pokemon theif Green across various towns as they encounter various powerful and unique Pokemon and their battle against gym leaders and the villainous team Rocket Organization. The story is unique, not at all related directly to the Anime or the GBA games. The characters haves their own emotional back story and history and a bind with their Pokemon. I love the way how new characters are introduced and how smoothly the story progresses with a few ups and downs. The Kanto region is set up very nicely with a well planned map, locations and natural artifacts. The most impressive thing about this manga is the drawing and the sketches. Just plain great! The black and white lines seem very real and unlike the GBA games, the Pokémon actually move and play in the battles. The graphics and the special effects are mesmerizing. In these three volumes, there are many villains,rivals, heroes, pokemon and more Pokemons that you stumble upon. Volume 1 is just the introduction to the most basic pokemon, Prof. Oak and Pokemon battles, capture process, gym leaders and the formation of mew. The team rocket is also involved here but much less as compared to the later volumes. Volume 2 digs deep more into reds story and how skillful he has grown. The gym leaders and their alliances are also a major plot twist. The three legendary Pokémon are revealed in this specific volume. Volume 3 shows the infiltration and defeat of the Team Rocket by Red, Blue, Green and the gym leaders. Many memorable battles take place in the volume. Even the Indigo League happens in this volume. Its the conclusion for reds adventure. <br/>  You can very quickly finish reading these manga volumes as they are graphic, gripping and have a nice retro touch. This is surely a feast for Pokemon fans. A very enjoyable, memorable and desirable read.

The story is inspired by GBA games but is written originally and the plot is just great and it feels good to read. The drawings are good and the basics are easily introduced. The black and white sketches are overwhelming and it seems as if we posses some great treasure when we see those ink drawings and monster moving and attacking on the paper. The writer has correctly said in the introduction that in GBA the Pokémon,rarely move much but he really redefines the concept of story, visualizations and good graphics. The introductory part, meting professor oak, rivalary with Green (He was known as blue in all the games I played),meeting and defeating he gym leaders and obtaining batches, the emotional connection of the traines and Pokemon's and the Rocket Team was extremely good. This manta is unique, overwhelming, graphiccally excellent and gives a good introductory statement.

The Kanto region is set up very nicely with a well planned map, locations and natural artifacts. The most impressive thing about this manga is the drawing and the sketches. Just plain great! The black and white lines seem very real and unlike the GBA games, the Pokémon actually move and play in the battles. The graphics and the special effects are mesmerizing. In these three volumes, there are many villains,rivals, heroes, pokemon and more Pokemons that you stumble upon. Volume 1 is just the introduction to the most basic pokemon, Prof. Oak and Pokemon battles, capture process, gym leaders and the formation of mew. The team rocket is also involved here but much less as compared to the later volumes. Volume 2 digs deep more into reds story and how skillful he has grown. The gym leaders and their alliances are also a major plot twist. The three legendary Pokémon are revealed in this specific volume. Volume 3 shows the infiltration and defeat of the Team Rocket by Red, Blue, Green and the gym leaders. Many memorable battles take place in the volume. Even the Indigo League happens in this volume. Its the conclusion for reds adventure. <br/>  You can very quickly finish reading these manga volumes as they are graphic, gripping and have a nice retro touch. This is surely a feast for Pokemon fans. A very enjoyable, memorable and desirable read.

Master Edition Volume 6 Review<br/><br/><br/>The last master volume in the series... I am left with sense impressions. This city is so huge. It easily extends across a star system, probably ours. What happens to digital life when we, the builders, die? What is the impact of the replication of life in silicon format? Will viruses mutate the silicon form or become a form unto themselves? And what is the benefit and role of the user or humanity in this frame?<br/><br/>I loved ReBoot which plumbed some of these depths in a more humorous way but the darkness and the integration of the online and offline world is a bit more interesting. I like this conceptual world more than the Matrix. I also appreciate the lack of philosophical posturing and religious iconography.<br/><br/>I was satisfied with this series. Many times I was lost with only my sense impressions to guide me, often awed by the movement between frames and the way that distance was portrayed. It added another dimension to make me, as a human, feel awed and small. That is worth the time spent reading this series.<br/><br/>This series ultimately proved fascinating and frustrating at the same time. The summaries are essential reading--I tried reading one of the books without reading the summary until afterwards and was astounded by what I failed to understand in the development of the story. I thoroughly enjoyed Nihei's expansive spaces and his imaginative characters, but action scenes tended to repeat themselves and how anyone managed to decipher the plot without inside information is utterly beyond me.<br/><br/>I claimed my final judgment would hinge upon whether or not any progress was made in finding the Net Terminal gene, and that final judgment is... mixed. When I finished there were hints Kyrii had maybe accomplished this part of the mission... somehow. <br/>A strange, haunting and a little humorous end for the series. Enjoyed it a lot, had no idea how it could’ve possibly ended but Nihei found away. This series is so beautiful. I know most will find the incoherent/secondary plot to be frustrating but I enjoyed the mystery of the strange Sci-Fi hell scale more than just a simple, typical heroic story. Loved that it just wound and wound and never really could be predicted.<br/><br/>A fabulous, imaginative, and huge-in-scope tale that would have been aided immensely with more editorial oversight.",,,1,0
30962984,BLAME!

Master Edition 3 Review<br/>  <br/>With each progressive volume, the terminologies and lore of the Net-Realm and the characters stranded in the midst the Toha Heavy Industries becomes complex but easy to understand at the same time as new events, logs and character additions manage to keep the story spicy all the time. Of course, this being BLAME! Expect a lot of gunfights, net terminal gene guardians and exterminators and antagonistic figures with an extraordinary scope to flex their power in mystic silhouette scenery which is very much prevalent in this volume. Two major silicon life forms play the role of the primary antagonists here and a lot of secondary plot threads begin to surface; equally interesting thanks to the legendary scope of artistic choices which I mentioned in earlier reviews. <br/>After the last volume’s world-changing crash of Cibo’s virtual entity and the formation of the hybrid with Sanaka after the latter’s apparent annihilation leads to a much-needed complexity and this serves as an entry point to a whole new aspect of the untouched technological marvel that the author bombards the reader within the introductory part of this volume; which eventually flourish and evolve the character on a massive level by the end, almost to a level of evolution. This volume leaned the most towards the science fiction side introducing gravity regulator, space elevators, access keys and an almost metaphysical AI force in Cave 13 in addition to most of the weapons based on electromagnetic principles and biochemical frameworks. The style and the story arc has certainly progressed as opposed to those in Master Edition Volume 1. <br/>I was particularly amazed by Kerri's identity reveal and his newly acquired powers make him a much stronger warrior. His character development is evident through his choices as he does not waver to fight the two highly artistically drawn Safeguards at Cave 8 before the arrival of one of the most promising and iconic duos this series has introduced, namely Mensab and Seu. I fell in love with both of them, well, to be honest, Seu just a bit more as their arrival was foretold with the chapter titled ‘Digital Knight’ and I’m a sucker for such grandiose names. Seu is just that and I cannot wait to see what goes down as he fights his way across the titans at Cave 13 for reacquiring his identity. This volume particularly involved a lot of jumping around, travelling, teleporting and discovering hidden areas and caches, as well as fashionable encounters with higher life forms and I, ’m glad that the manga is taking a darker turn and becoming more character-oriented so that it gives a chance for the reader to catch a break from it’s crushing and over-the-top world building involving the constant injection of inexplicable authoritarian figures. At this point, it is expected that Cibo’s arc will have a larger than life revelation but it doesn’t think the writer would turn her entirely towards the dark side. Lots of surprises await in the next volume. The architecture drawing was also exemplary and spaced out, with futuristic furnishings. The author did not hesitate to introduce a lot of Sci-Fi experimental and hypothetical marvels in this one and I’m glad he did so. And the action? It’s just out of this world kick-ass. Make this into an anime, please!!",,,1,0

I think the author needed a much-deserved break (I’m guessing the readers did too) as a lot of story-wise progression and explanation was due after the last three volumes covered major battle sequences and chaos unleashing time and time again. Anyways, the majority of this volume is about the consequences of the transfer protocols and partial destruction of the original location of the Toha Heavy Industries and the retirement of a few key players from the plot and introduction of fresh faces with a lot of scope and offerings. Primary of such new introductory characters is Dhomochevsky who gets a lot of page time here and to be honest, it feels uncharacteristic of the author to plan such long drawn out sequences with secondary characters. His interaction with Cibo felt a bit stretched to me. Most of the artwork that I gaped at while reading this one was the enormous explosions, the shifting of the landscape and the Shifting Metallic Towers. Very few major battles were seen in this one as most of the artistic efforts were put in plot progression and delving deep inside the newly formed location with the characters broken apart, each on their personal mission to either find the Net Terminal Gene, locate the other, obtain the system of keys and weapons cache or just trying to recover their lost parts and restore order to turn the tide against the Safeguards. Close inspection hints that the authors leave our protagonists in hands of their allies, who make their surprising debuts nodding towards anomalies within the Net System Megaworld. The Space-Time scope of this franchise is bigger than anything in the current trend of publishing wit the author taking bold and over-the-top choices with great skill and talent. The drawing was not too dark and shadowy in this issue but I was particularly impressed by the amazing representation of the Safeguards like Pcell and Dhomochevsky, who I think borrows a few traits from Kyrii. Most of this volume was focused in character development, plot progression and most importantly the exploration of a myriad of location and unearthing secrets like the ‘cloning machine’ and the lurking digital spirits in order to extract relevant information. Kyrii, of course, is still my favourite character seconded by Cibo just like many of you. This was another brilliant addition to a franchise that never stops to amaze me with it’s an ambitious and skilled take on such a demanding genre that is Sci-Fi. No doubt, this is equivalent to High Fantasy and I would certainly not think twice before tagging this as Hard Sci-Fi. I’m glad the readers received some breathing space in this one to just step away, shift back and take in the beautiful yet to-be-ruined Megaworld. The art just could not be better.

Master Edition Vol 2 Review<br/>  <br/>   This volume surpasses most of the manga's I’ve read in recent memory with all credit to the titanic and hugely ambitious storylines, plot progression in addition to the unrelenting, break-neck pace of action which suits the darker tones underlying the artistic choices. Every single page of the second master volume feels premium, I feel sad that this manga doesn’t have enough recognition because clearly it deserves it. The ever-expanding terminology of the cyber world is now reaching out to me and I think I can seamlessly understand all the switching platforms, adversaries, silicon nemesis’ that Karii faces along the way to achieve system stability by obtaining the Net Gene. Everything is taken up more than a notch, on a much grander scale; almost spiritual. By the final logs in this compendium, we even saw two colossal titans (a builder and a bot) face off against each other bombastically. The artist does not hold back. There is quite a lot of jaw-dropping and awe-inspiring moments throughout the volume. The art complements the story exceptionally with rough and dark undertones and the black and white contrast is so on point, esp. On occasions of explosions, thematic architecture tours and instances of dialogue in a quiet contemplative environment. The climactic confrontation with the female protagonist Cibo, getting spliced in two just after her hopeful confrontation with the seed pod by the sudden attack of the higher-life form predators was just painful and emotionally wrecking and that scene was so richly and masterfully drawn it almost felt divine. Right from the beginning, the stakes get high and I think, after the Log entry 13, the protagonists have a solid directive, a sort of a mission objective which adds much more to the reading value for me. The artwork fascinated me the most, to be honest. The story is solid enough in itself but it would be underwhelming if it wasn’t for the stylistic choices and rough brutal tones which land a solid impact and make the reading experience so much more intense. Coming back to the beginning, the character development was on an insane level with a lot of new major players being introduced by page hundred. Most of the surprising reveals leaned towards the ending but the beginning of this volume had a lot of speed and got a lot done. The architecture of the Toha Heavy Industries remains brilliant even though it’s a crumbling mega-net fortress, I’ll never be able to cope with how the artist has brought such an ambitious framework to life. The antagonist figures and consequent fights were on a whole new level- darker with the stakes stacked higher. Lots of weaponry and new moves involved. Man! A good adaption of this manga would be honest so good!! I just can’t get enough of this manga. With the way the second master volume has ended tragically, I cannot wait to lay my hands on the following master volume. This was something I never expected. The story took surprising turns and got way darker, the art more convincing and the terminologies heavier. This is as good as cyberpunk/steampunk gets.",,,1,0

I never thought a reading medium like manga could meet such fantastical heights, at least in terms of Science Fiction storytelling; exploring themes like Silicon Life, mechanized robots and automated weaponized system thriving in Ultra-Futuristic metallic skyscraper biomes and biochemical warfare. The manga starts off unpredictably with a strange duo facing dangers as they tread across vast lower platforms of the impressively constructed but somewhat ruined dome and fighting off against recurring antagonists. The story doesn’t give up all the details as the dialogue is kept to a bare minimum but this fact is justified with enough gory battle scenes with smoke and shrapnel flying three sixty degrees. Action and gunfights are the forefront of storytelling with enough gaps for the reader to catch a breath and sum up the events of the last chapters or shall I say “Log Entries” as the writer puts it. Each log progresses the manga not only in terms of the storyline but also massive world-building and somewhat of character development but it’s more like the technology lore unfolding itself, revealing fractions of interesting artefacts and hidden clues to what might come next. The artwork itself is ambitious and worth a lot of praise and admiration. I found myself mooning at a variety of sketches, esp. The architectural grandeur, the skeletal frameworks and the calm and collected role of the antagonists. Although, it is worth mentioning that BLAME! Needs to you read all the pages carefully, taking in the smallest of the details. I accidentally missed a page and abruptly landed in a major plot twist. A lot of secondary characters are introduced with each progressing log and the action grows wilder with each higher platform. Man! If this manga is adapted into an RPG/ platformer style video game someday, I’d be the first to sign up. Also, there’s a very vividly animated and highly creative Netflix movie adaption which I will be engorging before this week is up. I plan to finish the entire series in not more than seven days so I’ll be able to keep the reviews and the summary tight and nicely interweaved. A recurring pattern that occurs after each of the logs is that our protagonist makes it out of the ordeal he finds himself in as he scales the walls and makes past his nemesis(s), either single-handed or finding himself a surprising ally, he more or less remains unscathed and since we have absolutely zero background on it, except how his character is engaged in the current mission, it is somewhat of a getaway card for the author. The battle scenes are intense and captivating with a myriad of bio-intelligent machinery and weaponry introduced with each progressive battle. It is vital to keep a track of who’s who because the artwork can be very intimidating for first-time readers and there’s a lot to digest with the turn of every page. I’m enthralled by BLAME! with how it has achieved so much in just the first 400 pages. The climax absolutely blew me away with grandiose biome tubes, crumbling forts, mega bosses and the gathering storm. The payoff in the final faceoff was all that I could have asked for. But much of the story remains unravelled so stay tuned as I publish the reviews for further editions as well. At first, this may seem like a standard take on android and human lives intertwining with each other but this is so much more. The artwork is, of course, the primary catch and the dialogue, even though it’s ultra-minimalistic, hits hard when there’s a barrage of words. This action-centric wildly talented art manga blew me away and I managed to read the entire chunk in a single sitting in under three hours. A fantastic beginning to an immersive edition of one of the most phenomenal and revolutionary mangas out there.",,,1,0

It doesn't feature much gross artwork like Uzumaki but is certainly more terrifying. It makes the story appears just as ordinary before taking a sharp turn and the next moment there's blood-spattered everywhere, disemboweled bodies and shattered organs in abundant amount. Each chapter tells it's own story with Tomie as a recurring character. I personally think that she is an urban witch although her origins are never revealed each story ends surprisingly even though after a couple of chapters the reader obviously knows Tomie will plan her own death to be reanimated again and turn the tables. This plot works really nice coupled with horrifying and gory body brutality. Sometimes, even though the deaths of Tomie are of similar nature, the scenario is different and equally entertaining each time. The world-building is nice and the story is told via multiple locations. I would have liked a darker tone to the overall story and not just how the story becomes brutal *after* Tomie's planned death. But the concept is amazingly captured and artwork is complimentary. Amazing stuff. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

I parallelly read 5 books so this felt like a lowkey reading session and delivered much more than I'd expected. The seven/eight stories had impressive art and storytelling with a haunting a very memorable ending. There's a second volume which I've already picked up. I'm very impressed by the originality of the ideas and I'm rooting that these urban legends are known and popularized, at least in Japan. Certainly recommended for 15+. My favorite story was the first one which was decorated by nightmares, blood and nocturnal creatures-the bats, feeding and trying to keep their ""Master"" alive in a very explicitly shown gory process. The book and the art does not shy away from awkward and wayward stuff and makes a statement with a believable and bone-chilling narration with a doom-like atmosphere looming over every storyline. Some of the pages seemed unnecessary and fell flat but this is a magnificent piece of art and storytelling. Loved It! Nice Reading!",,,1,0

Junji Ito's writing style and art have a characteristic to it which is rarely seen in the mangas published today. the eerie atmosphere, the downplaying, the subtle clues and easter eggs, the unrelenting and unapologetic and explicit representation of disfigured bodies and gore coupled with a plot-centric storyline makes this a perfect selection for a single sitting Readathon. I'm somewhat disappointed in myself for not drawing u the courage to stay awake and attempt to read this from dusk till dawn but even in daylight, Uzumaki can be a harrowing and scaring reading experience, especially to the younger and uninitiated audience. The blood, disfigurement, and spiral frenzy is evident in abundance at every turn of the page. The manga starts really well with each chapter telling a dark and violent tale of things going bad for the citizens of this madness driven village. Of course, the central characters are limited but with each chapter, an unforgettable picture is embedded in your mind. Personal favorites are 'Labyrinth, Completion, The Firing Effect, Mosquito, Crescent Scar, Umbilical cord and others' The tone is heavy for the first 10 chapters which serve as their own short tales although elements from each of these stories resurface during the final moments of the manga. Chapters 10-15 were the dullest, in my opinion, but had some disturbing and entertaining scenes. Chapters 16-20 were the best, richly crafted and masterfully delivered. The crazy town navigation, escape attempts, and the final confrontation in the underground city of spiral simply blew my mind. The art is gothic, dark, and unrelenting. The author does not hold back at all, in this manga, you will find plenty of upsetting visuals. The terror and horror which Uzumaki strieks in the readers mind is unparalled and unprecedented. A great reading experience... The first chapters lay the base for horror and the final chapters embraced the gross and menacing fascinations of the Sprially impaled town. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

Its fantasy meeting Shonen and Goku is a the most imaginably cool and cute and funny charachter. Charachter reminds me that there's just about a hundred charachters here, distributed in thirty one volumes some frail, weak, some strong like hell and some just wierd and funny and humbug. The story goes:- Goku is the main protagonist of the series and he is approached by a girl named Bulma who's in search for the dragon balls on their way they meet an old man who tries to gets seduced, Kame Sama. And theres Krulin, a young monk fighter and also oolong and yamcha. The villian for the first half of the volumes is the blue empereor and the Red Ribbon Gang. Along the way, the droagon is summoned and can grant you any wish. Any at all. But what happens when the power falls in dark hands? Then theres goku and the gang coming in! For the rescue of course. They difeat the coloured rangers and ninjas and robotic machines, giant snakes and all is well in the end. Piccolo also appears later at the Bodukai Tournament. It is held about seven times in the whole series and it just amazes me. Truly great stuff. Piccolo somehow is defeated and sealed away while he also sends down his son Kid Picollo to get his revenge upon Goku. There's a great fight but in the end Picollo is just defeated by Goku and gets mad. The second half of the volumes namely Dragon Ball Z portrayes a race of saiyans who want to capture the earth. These volumes go deep in the history of planets around the earth, Namek especially and in Goku's history and his past. Here are the worlds greatest villians like Frieza and Vegeta and also Buu and The ANDROids. Each one anothers boss. Then theres the plo where Goku and Vegeta have kids and they can transform themselves into super saiyans form and get the whole power. Just a great series that i have admired and read.

Its fantasy meeting Shonen and Goku is a the most imaginably cool and cute and funny charachter. Charachter reminds me that there's just about a hundred charachters here, distributed in thirty one volumes some frail, weak, some strong like hell and some just wierd and funny and humbug. The story goes:- Goku is the main protagonist of the series and he is approached by a girl named Bulma who's in search for the dragon balls on their way they meet an old man who tries to gets seduced, Kame Sama. And theres Krulin, a young monk fighter and also oolong and yamcha. The villian for the first half of the volumes is the blue empereor and the Red Ribbon Gang. Along the way, the droagon is summoned and can grant you any wish. Any at all. But what happens when the power falls in dark hands? Then theres goku and the gang coming in! For the rescue of course. They difeat the coloured rangers and ninjas and robotic machines, giant snakes and all is well in the end. Piccolo also appears later at the Bodukai Tournament. It is held about seven times in the whole series and it just amazes me. Truly great stuff. Piccolo somehow is defeated and sealed away while he also sends down his son Kid Picollo to get his revenge upon Goku. There's a great fight but in the end Picollo is just defeated by Goku and gets mad. The second half of the volumes namely Dragon Ball Z portrayes a race of saiyans who want to capture the earth. These volumes go deep in the history of planets around the earth, Namek especially and in Goku's history and his past. Here are the worlds greatest villians like Frieza and Vegeta and also Buu and The ANDROids. Each one anothers boss. Then theres the plo where Goku and Vegeta have kids and they can transform themselves into super saiyans form and get the whole power. Just a great series that i have admired and read.

The books should have been much more horror. This is very plain and seems like a mystery book. Not much of a mystery which gets uncovered at the last line of the book with no history and reasonable reasons. I don't like the characters much, just that of Zeebe. Even the dialogues and descriptions are boring. Half of the book is covered with false frightening cliffhangers that aren't very much scary. Most of the time our ""detectives"" go IP and down the trapdoor for their secret exploring. The teacher is a nuisance too and I don't know about how he handles these kids. The story is unstable and you can easily forget it in a day or two. Things keep happening with different characters at different places, which mixes up and confuses the reader making him want to stop reading. The only thing I like is the witty humour and the cheap thrills that the ""detectives"" have. As far as I'm concerned, I would never recommend this to anyone. Not even a 5 year old kid. But the style of writing is exceptional. The details and how Stine describes the architecture and the emotions of he characters. I will settle for a two star out of five.<br/>Plot<br/><br/>Brooke Rodgers and Zeke Matthewsare in the school play called The Phantom. Later on, Brooke hears a story from a girl in the play that does the scenery. The girl tells Brooke a story about how a boy who was supposed to be the phantom in 1923 disappeared. Everyone including his parents got worried. The police looked everywhere and never found his body. If they try to do the play again his ghost appears on the stage.<br/><br/>Brooke and Zeke are aspiring thespians, having appeared in the previous school year's production ofGuys and Dolls. When Brooke and Zeke go to look at the cast list for the new, scary show that they tried out for, Brooke discovers a note pinned to the board telling her that she has been suspended. Upon whirling around, Zeke laughs and reveals he set up the joke.<br/><br/>The play, called The Phantom, is a heavily edited version of The Phantom of the Opera. Zeke receives the lead role as the Phantom and Brooke is cast as Esmerelda. A seventh-grader named Tina (who does not much like Brooke), discovers she is Brooke's understudy and also is in charge of scenery. At the script reading the next week, Tina reveals that the play is cursed. Tina starts to tell about how there is an actual phantom in the school. But she is interrupted by Ms. Walker, the director, who tells her that the story is, ""Very scary... very upsetting."" However, she gives in and reveals the old legend to the class. The legend reveals that seventy-two years ago, a student found a copy of the play called The Phantomin the basement. The boy showed the play to a teacher who decided the school would perform it. On opening night, however, the boy disappeared, and was never found again. After that night, all copies of the script were destroyed (except one, which was kept locked in a safe). The play was never performed again.<br/><br/>Ms. Walker tells the class that they will be ignoring the rumor that the ghost of the boy-the 'Phantom' will not let them perform the play. She then disappears out of nowhere. As students worry and scramble, Ms. Walker reveals that she had used a trap door below the stage. She has the children help her up and then excitedly tells them that they will be using said trap for theatrical effect during their play, but to not use it before it is fixed, due to safety reasons.<br/><br/>Brooke gives us a brief synopsis of The Phantom. A man named Carlo owns a theater. Beneath the theater lives a phantom with a scarred and hideous face. Esmerelda-in the original book, Christine-the daughter of Carlo, falls in love with the Phantom, but her handsome boyfriend Eric finds out...and kills the Phantom. Esmerelda runs away and the Phantom haunts the theater forever.<br/><br/>After everyone leaves rehearsals, Zeke and Brooke stick around to try out the trap door in secret. They go down the trap door, but instead of stopping at a certain height, they keep going...and eventually they are beneath the school, in a vast, dark corridor. Suddenly, the platform begins to move up again and the two jump onto it as it goes back up. The platform stops a little short of the stage, so the two have to hoist themselves up. Once on the stage, they run into Emile, the ""night janitor"", an old man with a big purple scar on his face. He chides them on using the trap door and tells them to leave. Later it is found out that the school does NOT have a night janitor.<br/><br/>The next day at school, there is a new boy sitting in Brooke’s chair named Brian, claiming to have just moved from Indiana. He compliments Brooke on starring in the play and tells of his past theatrical, albeit small roles; she finds him attractive. Brooke runs out to her locker after talking to Brian and inside her locker there is a note written in red crayon, written:<br/><br/>""STAY AWAY FROM MY HOME SWEET HOME.""<br/><br/>Brooke thinks Zeke is behind the letter. Despite her belief, he vehemently denies it.<br/><br/>After school, Brian asks Ms. Walker if there are any parts left in the play. She tells him that unfortunately, there are not; however, he can work with Tina on the stage crew. Suddenly, the lights go out, and there is a terrifying scream in the auditorium. A masked man comes swooping down from the catwalk and disappears down the trap door. This time, Brooke is absolutely certain it is Zeke. Afterward, Tina tries to blame the incident on Brooke, since, ""Zeke is YOURfriend, after all.""<br/><br/>Ms. Walker lets rehearsals out early and Brooke goes out to the parking lot, where she sees Zeke in his mother's car. Apparently, he had a doctor's appointment. Brooke then asks him if he simply performed his antics and THEN went to the appointment... Zeke simply laughs.<br/><br/>The next day at play rehearsal, Brooke forgets her lines at the purposeful fault of the malicious Tina. But then, the Phantom appears again from the platform and begins violently shaking Brooke before disappearing again. This time, it could not have been Zeke, for he was watching from the front row. Later, Zeke and Brooke decide to go to the school's main office and ask if perhaps Emile, the ""night janitor"" had turned in a book Zeke had left in the auditorium. While shutting the computer and preparing to leave, the secretary informs him that the school does not have a night janitor.<br/><br/>Brooke and Zeke later talk the new guy, Brian, into helping them catch the Phantom in the school. Planning to break into the school, they find no entrance. Then, Brian finds a ground-level entrance; the home-economics room. With the faint aroma of cranberry muffins, the three sneak from the cooking room into the school. Trekking the very dark halls, they eventually come upon the dark, damp auditorium. With a good look at the stage, however, and in dim light, they see the backdrop slowly lowering itself. Aviolently-written message in splattered red paint reads the same as Brooke's mysterious note:<br/><br/>""STAY AWAY FROM MY HOME SWEET HOME.""<br/><br/>At the most inconceivably inappropriate time, Ms. Walker coincidentally enters the auditorium and catches the three of them staring at the now badly-vandalized backdrop. She firstly accuses them of of the crime, but several genuine explanations later, and Ms. Walker almost believes them. As proof, she sees a trail of red paint leading from the backdrop into the hallways. Relieved, the group starts to follow the trail before discovering that the trail leads to Zeke's locker. Now furious, Ms. Walker demands Zeke to open the locker. Flustered, he quickly undoes the lock and as Brooke and her teacher peer in, they see a can of red paint. Now, no matter how much protesting Zeke does, he cannot explain himself out of such a purely incriminating situation. He's not only grounded, facing charges, and in deep trouble with his parents...he is also ejected from the play.<br/><br/>Robert Hernandez, Zeke's understudy, takes his place. Brooke thinks he is much too serious a person and is just not the same as Zeke, whom she can joke around with. At rehearsal, Ms. Walker finds her script's pages glued together. In a fit of pent-up rage, she chucks her script and declares that the play is canceled. After calming down from her irrational behavior, however, she retracts her former statement and allows the play to continue production,<br/><br/>Afterward, Brian and Brooke go to visit Zeke at his house (since his parents are at the movies), where he is still grounded. Outraged, Zeke vows to try one last time to catch the Phantom. The trio goes back to the school at night again, and find their way down the trapdoor, this time into a tunnel. Brooke has another one of her long sneezing fits, which scares and alarms them all in fear of the Phantom hearing. Even worse, the trapdoor starts rising by itself back to the top again....and this time, they can't catch it on time. They are stuck in the basement. So, they decide to explore the tunnel. Finding a slightly smaller-than-average door, they decide to open it. To their strange surprise, they find a small, but fully-furnished room. There is even a fresh bowl of corn flakes on a table. Zeke figures that since the flakes aren't soggy yet, the Phantom must be nearby. They enter, but discover that they are then locked out. After slamming and pushing on the door with all their strength, Brooke eventually figures out that the door must be pulled, not pushed,<br/><br/>The door then opens with ease and, standing in front of them in fury, is Emile. As it turns out, he's simply a homeless man whose father actually worked for the school many years ago. He knew about the underground room, and after losing his actual home, decided to make a clandestine move-in. After finding out that people started fooling around with the trapdoor and getting nearer and nearer to discovering him, he started painting the warnings. However, he does not understand why Brooke keeps referring to the Phantom. As she tells him about the play seventy-two years ago, he smiles bitterly and admits that he is only fifty years of age. The three are astonished as it dawns upon them that it is impossible for him to be the Phantom. But then, Emile starts moving towards them and telling them that he warned them. Obviously scared, they dash away from him and find that oddly enough, he is not chasing them. They find the trapdoor at the bottom, and as they ride the top, they discover Zeke's father waiting for them. Asking how he found them, he says that upon coming home, Zeke was not there. Even though still grounded, he figured that Zeke would be back at school fooling around with the trapdoor again. As he says Zeke is still grounded, though, the three begin to rapidly explain the situation. Calling an officer in to go down and investigate, he finds the room still furnished...but no books, cornflakes, or sign of Emile.<br/><br/>Zeke gets his part back, as it is now obvious that he was not the culprit. As Brooke prepares her makeup for closing night, she sees Zeke in full costume, and looking impressive. She wishes him good luck, but in a quite un-Zeke-like manner, he simply gives her a very formal bow. The play goes very well...but halfway through Act I, when the Phantom makes his dramatic appearance, Brooke figures out that the Phantom isn't Zeke. It is the real Phantom.<br/><br/>In the final scene of the play, after the Phantom dramatically rises in dry-ice mist and from the trap door, Esmeralda (really Brooke) asks the Phantom a question. Instead of answering with the correct lines, the Phantom gives a short speech about how he died on opening night and had been haunting the stage, excitedly awaiting for his chance to play the role. The audience goes wild, as the scene turns out to be very good. While the audience fervently applauds and cheers, Brooke snatches the mask and tries to look at the Phantom's face. Strongly refusing, he covers his face.To his advantage, a spotlight is shone directly at Brooke and she is temporarily blinded. Not able to see either since he is covering his face, the Phantom slowly walks backward...straight into the open trapdoor. Falling into deep darkness, Brooke runs and peers into the opening, able to see nothing. The audience by now is going insane, since they all think it is part of their rendition of the show. After the curtain closes, Zeke shows up in regular clothes, confused and inquiring as to what had just taken place. As it turns out, he had been knocked out cold by the Phantom, so he could play the part instead of Zeke.<br/><br/>Brooke stops off at her locker with Zeke. As she opens it, another strange thing falls out, but not a note. It is an antiquated yearbook of their school, from the 1920s...exactly seventy-two years before. They flip through it, and encounter the theatrical production page titled ""'The Phantom' to be performed in the spring"". Instantly interested, they look at the lead role cast picture for the Phantom. The boy who had found the script in the basement, the boy who won the star role...was Brian.",,,1,0

Martin Review<br/><br/><br/>I read this right after Fire and Blood: The Expansion Targaryen history and both of these books can be classified under the additional Westeros info compendium. Both of them share some similarities, the narration is very much different but the major intention behind writing these expansion info series about Westeros, it's culture, the people, the lands and the reigns over this magnanimous land is to grow and entertain the fanbase and put some definitve lore answers out there. This is a masterfully crafted, ingenious, thoughtful creation. With all the locations, races, mythes, folklores and the collected knowledge this acts like a westerospedia. A massive book full of info and short but entertaining happenings over time throughout Westeros, Essos and the free cities. I had a nice time reading this. I brushed past the last 200 pages very easily, in under two days. The first half of the book seems redundant as it is filled with the Targaryen history which GRRM has already written a 700 paged tome about. So I only read the parts I missed out on in the first half. I feel like a westerosi Patriot/hedge knight who has lived through this mystical and turmoil filled continent for a my life. I'm glad there's a much needed lore/pedia book for the much beloved ASOIAF series. This was superb and had a lot of entertaining narratives and key events which greatly affect the future of the series. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

I now understand why this fantasy series is contemporary and held in such high regard by critics. The narration has become more mature and Guin has understood her Target audience and implemented various writing styles, the ich prose and fast paced plot stil; inherent and unaffected. The last book explored various locations and had way more action and excitement but this book in it's own right counters that and delivers a single primary located story, a limited set of characters, emotionally driven narrative highlighted by a redemption arc which has a brilliant payoff. This novel was emotionally fulfilling, had a very lovable female lead you can always invest in as well as a rich setting. Of course, Ged makes his comeback. It was fresh and exciting to have the new girl have a first person narrative as she struggles to realize her faith and the exploitative situation based on an almost real, attached to history empire about the Godkings. There were a few terms I was familiar with, a major one being the Faceless ones thanks to my all time favorite Derek Landry's SKulduggery Pleasant. I can't actually point my finger to it but there is something to this over that feels peculiarly unique, something about how the plot progresses and the choices that the characters make. The world of Earthsea, or to be more specific the protagonists are so pure of heart and the dialogues are not short of interesting anecdotes and wise advices to the reader This novel is an interesting addition to the series and the story took an interesting direction which I would not have expected. The next book teases sea adventures and dragons!  Nice Reading!",,,1,0

Guin has managed to race through the plot while keeping the characters dense and easy to follow in under 25 pages. It has all the makings of a fantasy book and I'm very much enjoying the setting and the style of writing. This is exactly what I like in a book. I have a feeling that I'll speed through the series in under a week if things go as planned. <br/>*This chapter introduces the readers to the heavily crafted map of Earthsea, which is a large archipelago. In the last 10 pages of the chapter, the readers get to know and understand the shipman's occupation and at least a pass on summary of ten or so islands to the centre of Earthsea. The character development is evident. I'm a bit sad that Gedd choose Wizardy School over his wizard master. Guin tells a lot about nature and the balance of magic. It's getting deeper, layers are being added to the story and it is definitely fast paced. <br/>*This chapter really sets the tone for the book. Ged is a budding wizard with an exponential learning curve. The systems of magic are extensively described and explained by multiple sorcerers in Roke. A significant time jump and minor location shift is highlighted and the characters grow older and wiser. The narrative is fast paced and there is a buildup In this chapter that might heighten the action once again. Lots of wise words spoken here. <br/>*This might perhaps be the most important chapter yet. Lots of metaphors hidden through the narrative. Guin gives larger than life messages and presents them simply andmakes them accessible. At the end of the chapter Ged is eighteen years old and a qualified wizard. The shadow is unlocked and one of the Masters passes away. This chapter talks extensively about the 'pride comes before fall' thing for Ged. But, in the end, all is well and he turns out to be powerful than ever but the Shadow isn't bested yet. The chapter ends on a high note and expecting wanting adventure next would be normal. <br/>*The chapter 'The Dragon of Pendor' has a much more Arthurian feel to it, because He's portrays a young but almost fully mature wizard who fights off dragon offsprings and binds the Dragon of Pendor' by casting it's true name. This has all the makings of a contemporary fantasy and gripping narrative. The elements like a small Hamlet, Wizard to the rescue and the environs of an alternate reality or at least medieval setting adds a lot of ambience to the story. <br/>*Upto the penultimate chapter, the story is a bit slow with not much action though there is eminent character evolution. The wizard adventure is halted and Ged tries his best to survive and explore the cities with the help of some assistance. It's a more soulful leadup to the climax unlike most other fantasy books <br/>*A bit of an anticlimactic end, but at least everyone is alive and together. It's almost like  a fantasy island RPG game ending.",,,1,0

The Witcher books are the best example of Sword and Sorcery genre. Right from the beginning, Geralt holds true to his roguish and outlandish character styles which develops gradually like layers of colours with every page. A lot of new characters were introduced. Most of the story is in form of dialogues, almost 80% of it and the author has a flourishing vocabulary and the choice of words is very surprising and interesting. Deserves to be in a limelight. Loved the ending, absolutely. Full of action, eloquence, unorthodox narration, rich high fantasy feel and euphemistic swearing and explicitness. Delightful reading experience. This story makes a transition from 'The Last Wish' and massively expands the World of Witcher Lore. I swear I'm gonna learn some quotes from this. Pretty smooth...<br/><br/>II<br/>*A Shard of Ice*<br/><br/>This short story talks about Geralt's complex relationship with Yennifer, the sorceress and introduces Istredd.  Geralt's past is expanded and examined in depth here. There's isn't much action taking place and the story turns in a different direction than you would expect. But still, the powerful dialogues between Istredd and Geralt give the readers a lot to take away. The ending was a bit confusing for me. Don't miss this.<br/><br/>III<br/>*The Eternal Flame*<br/>This story felt very original and realistic to me despite it's fantastic fictiousness. The eternal Diane expands upon the social and economic conditions of the world the Witcher inhabits. The Doppler monster works wonders with the storyline. I was a bit annoyed at multiplicity of dialogues and addition of unnecessary number of characters but in the end it all worked very well, suiting the story. The readers get to see the Witcher responses and descision making strategy first hand. This book has a very different feel than the last wish. Also Dandelion is reintroduced in this story so expect some trivial chat and die hard humour and explicitness. Fun reading. Especially, the beliefs of the commanding rulers about religion and the eternal flames glory.<br/><br/>IV<br/>*a Little Sacrifice*<br/>This story was pretty wierd even by Witcher standards. I found it to be very similar too the Aquaman movie plot. The Witcher helps stop the breaking of war between the ocean world and the surface world and helps two individuals of different species mingle with each other. Probably the most dull story in the book. But the narration seemed wonderful and paired with the dialogues it was tolerable. <br/><br/>V<br/>*Sword of Destiny*<br/>This is probably the most exciting story in the book, not only because it introduces another major character Ciri (Cirilla) but because we also get to know about the dryads in the Witcher world. And not just know, this goes way deep. The entire story has subtle details which lead to a very imaginative and realistic reading experience, this sets up for a first class fantasy storyline, even better than LoTR. The visual imagery of Sapkowski is remarkable indeed. The story builds a darker tone towards the end with ideas about destiny, sacrifice and war expressed in a way I simply could not have imagined before. Pay good heed to the Witcher's and the dryad queens conversation. It actually gave me shivers. Also, Ciri is another great addition to the storyline, she changes the way Geralt act and transforms him into an entirely different person. The wide cast of characters complement each other and add and play an important & notable.part in the storyline. Something tells me this characters (all of 'em) may appear in the future installments of wither books. Most of the story takes place in the enchanted Forest of the dryads. Had a very powerful ending and conclusion. More Witcher stories need to be this powerful and imaginative. <br/><br/>VII<br/>*Something More*<br/>This story, where can I even begin? It can be split into two parts. The remiscnces and phantasmal dreams about Yennifer and about Geralt's confrontation with Calinthre and pairing with Ciri.  The first part of the book had much action and the dream sequences of the Gerlat relaly blew me away, that was really unexpected. I think a lot of time passes between this story and it's predecessor. Anyways, it really seemed amazing how intricately the author describes the dream sequences of The Wither and sets things right with Yennifer. This was really worth reading but the following part was more exciting which talked about the Witcher's contribution towards the betterment of the world and getting the praise he really deserved. The confrontation between Geralt and Queen Calinthre was beyond expression of words. The exchange of dialogues was so dramatic and heartfelt. Some very high and upper end thoughts there. In fact, some of my favorite quotes are from that scene. Geralt's realization about Ciri and his destiny at the conclusion was a commendable twist. The final chapters work really well towards setting up the premise for the original Witcher pentalogy and I'm very glad to finally begin the actual series. The knowledge about the expansion and world building of the Witcher and the lore, characters and the background really helps. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

I'm very much impressed by the book, not the story as such because not a lot of stuff (from storyline point of view) occurs but the author has implied a lot of depth and dedicated numerous pages for character building and complex high fantasy tropes notable in any modern fantasy novel nowadays. Alina Starkov has undergone a character evolution and has gone down towards a darker path, not necessarily her own decision. The growing rift between Mal and Alina is very much worrying to me but it all is balanced out by the introduction of ambitious and gorious characters having a lot of depth and build-up and yes, I'm talking about Nikolai the prince of Ravka, the second eldest to be precise. Now, I don't know where the author is taking the whole build-up of the story and where the third novel will head toward but I can certainly confirm that Kore and legends the local mythology will heavily influence the pace and the nature of the storyline. I have nothing to complain about this book expect that Bardugo has mastered character development, dialogues and conversations and the silent gestures but lacks in pacing the storyline and adding new and interesting elements to it, especially action and adventure. Sorry to say but the book has taken a more political and subtle route. I'm ablsoultely Loving the new characters including Alina's exotic twin make/female bodyguards, Nikolai is totally smug with a smitten vocabulary and flair for hysterics, his elder brother, V is haughty and enjoys the excess, the Apparat is creepy as ever and only makes one terrifying appearance but I'm sure he will play a role in the final book thanks to how this book ended. The Darkling appears a lot in Alina's dreams and shapes her persona coercing her to turn it the dark side and revel in her true power. Of course, the book is narrated through Alina's POV and her emotions just spilling all over the book. I've to say that I never have seen a character go down a darker and a scarier road so quickly but thank the Lord that she hasn't yet gone on a killing spree. The climax was thrilling with the convergence of all the plotlines and the character coming together, some full of Hope, others with complete despair and taking a full force against the Darkling. The energy trade between the Darkling and Alina was certainly the highlight of the book. The first half of the book was also quite interesting with most of it happening on the shops and the latter part in the total castle with banquets and emotional conflicts between malaand Alina and whatnot. The author has certainly taken the character's we loved from the 'Shadow and Bone' and thrown them in dark and disastrous Waters with new dimensions, characters and personalities and it all plays out in 'Siege and Storm'. I would have liked to see a bit more character buil up on the Darkling but I guess the concluding book will have a lot to insight on that. I really liked the pacing of the book, the locations, the narrative and the natural flow with he ialogues. I enjoyed eacha dnevery conversation between Nikolai and Alina. one last thing, a lot of the story covers legends about Saints and Santvi and I did not really find it relevant to the actual present story but I guess the author has good reasons for introducing a religious key element that might payoff in the next book. The people of Ravka are enlightened as Alina is glorified as a Sun Saint and a powerful diety-being. And did I like the ending? Well, we all know ALina's gonna get her powers back some way or the other so there's no stressing about that. The only thing I'm Inverness about is the lengths Alina is willing to go to get her hands on the final artefact, the Falcon Phionex and put an end to the Darkling for once and for all.

Being Bardugo's debut work this stands in high regard with other fantasy series though I'll acknowledge that it isn't LOTR or The Wardrobe Chronicles, Septimus Heap or the usual staple high fantasy. No, here the author takes a much more subtler but quite impressive path with a minimal cast of characters, comparitively less work building and a good enough to go magic system where we see upto three or four characters engage in magic and other supernatural transformation. The book, undoubtedly is plot-driven and more so, character driven with the author heavily and extensively expanding upon Alina Starkov and Darlings characters and notably others too like Mal, Genya Ivan. Once the first three chapters were over I knew I was in for a surprise and things could go so wrong for the protagonists. The writing style is so simplistic and fluid which makes skimming through the text as easy as possible. Like I said, the locations and characters are minimum but the author has described this limited gems very carefully with consideration of future books too or so it seems. What I really liked about the book is the background of Alina and her pure hopeless romantic feelings towards Mal and how she is dragged into the politics of the courtroom and has to face treachery, betrayal and slavery at the hands of the Darkling. Now, I was a bit suspicious of that fellow right form the beginning it does not explain how the nation of Ravka was unaware and ignorant of his exploits and ambitions and how easily he takes his death over the centuries to build up a new purpose of righting his ancestors (there are none, he was the black Heretic himself as revealed later) wrongs of the Fold. The Fold is a superb concept, there's nothing much to it but the idea itself is the central build-up of the story and everyone struggles to change in a their own ways as possible. There's not really much action in the book except the light against the darkness part which if you have a good imagination and conjure a beautiful portrait will surely be memorable but still I wish there was at least a bit more creativity in the battles. About Midway, the book takes a major turn in both nature and direction and throws characters into a mess that lasts until the last page of the book. It really was wonderful to see Alina and Mal survive the wilds together and their sweet origin story with the old woman Ana. The plot devices are not too original but entertaining nonetheless. The amplifier and the deer antler scene was the highlight of the book. Another thing that gets me going about the series is the majority of the content is dialogues and conversations and how natural and cliche they sound. I would suggest not opting for an audiobook and diving into a silent reading experience to feel the way Alina and the Darkling feel about their own philosophies. It's definitely  a fun and enjoyable read and to be honest I finished this chunk in less than a day. A definite page with immense potential and very simplistic plotline that deserves to be ready and appreciated by amateur fantasy readers and young adults alike. The descriptions of the Kings palace was intricate and detailed just the way I like it. There's much chemistry and complications and false appearances in the courtroom and major secondary characters there might plays a vital role in the future books. I especially liked the character of Genya and the Queen and in conjunction with the 'Tomb-like; smelling priest that the Darkling has appointed the author did leave a trail of Easter eggs and dropped hints regarding how angerous things might occur in the next installments. It is worth noting the immense efforts Bardugo has taken in building and classifying the Grisha's (the soldiers of the second army) and their function in protecting and serving the kingdom. This strikes me as a mid-fantasy setting with lots and lots of funny and serious moments equally balanced and a classy medieval kingdom where thing can get bad real soon. The sequel demands my immediate attentiona and it is imperative that I devour it! Nice Reading!",,,2,0

Scythe is undoubtedly an achievement for the speculative fiction genre. The extensive depth and the mechanism of this scientifically advanced world deserves an applause. Of course, it has a YA feel to it but the writing is not turned down for the age limit but flourishes with each chapter. The first few chapters are very engaging; I was absolutely hooked. This is a page turner with a strong build-up and growing action. I love the way how a journal extract precedes each of the chapters and offers insight about this world which is less in the grasp of the nature and shaped to the anthropogenic liking. The philosophy an the idea of the story is certainly intriguing and the author puts in much efforts and thoughts and breaks the conventional typical storyline that the audience may anticipate. <br/>   Evasion of death and employment of Scythes has more dynamics than you can imagine. The system of the Scythe Domain is exceptionally well crafted and works best with this story. Citra and Rowan are not the best characters ever but they certainly top any of the characters in my recent reading experiences and each of their character arc is amazing. Thankfully, they are not bombared with cliches and common tropes;the book does not tend to be overly romanticized at any point and that's great! The dialogue and theinologues over various scythe offers great wisdom to the reader, and perhaps aims at a realistic possible future. The thunderhead thing is astonishing... I'm very glad that this is not a dystopian fantasy but a well crafted Speculative Sci-Fi trilogy and I'm very much willing to continue it. Binged in just 3 days! Would have loved to see more bonus content at the end of the book. I will be tweeting my favorite quotes form this soon. The sudden turn of events and the ghastly choices that Citra and Rowan have to face certainly elevates the suspense and the thrill of the story. It is very engaging, hooking and addictive. Loved everything about it. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

I've aid it before end I'll say it again, the series had immense potential right from the first book and it managed to stay upto expectations with the second book by introducing surprising plot points and characters like the smug price Nicolai but majority of this book feels like a wasted effort and it's Crystal clear that the author is trying too hard to get her message about the dark theme of the series across the readers and that does not work very well. I'm not saying that it's entirely bad, nope, the climax, aftermath, epilogue, a few dialogues and especially chapter 11-12 were the best parts of the book and honestly credit goes to these parts in the book for earning a three star rating. Forgive me but this is going to be a bit critical but please bear with me. The book starts off right where it left off and I, for one storngly believe that the author has wasted too much words trying to explain and get the character's out of their current 'underground captivation/hostile' situation plus there's also a point of the third amplifier, the Phionex being totally obsolete and the reveal that Mal is the third amplifier thanks to his oh-so far fetched Morozaki bloodline and I'm played by the though that there was absolutely no clue/hint about this in the past books. There must be countless times when Mal has had some affectionate contact with Alina and at didn't trigger her powers? That is some bad storytelling, honestly this has a significant number of plot holes. What I loved the most about the book was it's fast paced, fluid, engaging and active descriptive narration and how it made me actually care about her priar characters. Honestly, I did not pay much attention to the secondary characters except Nikolai, Baghra and Genya while other just faded into the storyline and I had a premonition that in the near future half of these sideeekicks will face final destination but anyways, kudos to the author for an engaing writing style, love struke characters, an impressive love triangle (calling it a quadrangle would make much more sense, haha!) and intense action scenes and the epilogue was just great, one of the best emotional payoffs ever! Even Baghra's backstory took a darker turn than I'd expected and I totally loved it. Much of the book constantly refers to the in-book  Morozoi and his Sankta works, including his works on the three amplifiers and his reckless quest for the final Ravkan symbol of the all powerful Phionex. I gawped at the fact that the Darkling has absolutely lost his villainous charm and has become a third grade antagonist who has a single effective skill and no expertise at all and the way he died was just disagreeable to me. And his last words, 'Don't let me be lonely, bury me Sun Summoner's Excuse me but that is some crazy stuff right there. The series also keeps alluding to the Ravkan politics and the constant discrimation among power ranks. I enjoyed Mal's personal growth but his breakdown was something I did not have a stomach for. Nikolai was thoroughly entertaining and his transformation into a preying vampiric beast was gut wrenching for me but it all turned out fine in the end. On the whole I liked this book there there were just way too many loose ends and missed opportunities which, if cleared and corrected would land this book on 'My Favorite Series of the Year' shelf but alas! The ending was amazing and I really look forward to reading more of Leigh Bardugo, in fact I'm immediately diving into the Six of Crows duologue which is much more appreciated than this series. It's been a hell of a journey. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

It was unputdownable, simply. I'm the meta pop culture geek and this book seemed like it was designed just for me. Games, Music, Tv, Pop Culture References and Virtual Reality Simulation is something I crave for every second of my existence and I've already seen the movie, so this book delivers content that I just could not look away from. The plot is fast paced, set in the future, dystopian and insanely sci-fi styled. I related myself with Wade Watts very much. Cline does an absolutely amazing job with the prologue setting the tone up for the readers and giving a hardcore 80's pop culture references and easter eggs almost at every single page. I opine that this is a unique aspect of the book which sets it apart from thousands of other sci-fi novels and gave it a boost for mass popularity because its's immersive, relatable and packed with fandom. The book is complex for an uninitiated reader as there's too many characters in real life as well as simulations, multiple major plotpoints, technical information anddaraa regarding technology and powerful institutions all set in a highly futuristic world which may seem like a bit t much but ero even a little weathered reader this feels like a piece of cake and a delightful reading experience. For me, this book qualifies as a yardstick against all future sci-fi books may be measured. It's insanely well written with good vocabulary standard and fast pace flow of story narration. As it's a first POV narration it feels really immersive. I adored the characters like Perzival, Art3mis, Aech, James Halliday. To tell the truth, the book slacks a bit with he romantic entanglement of Wade and Art3mis but leave that point out and there's your masterpiece. james Halliday's life inspires me and reminds me of my young days when I used t spend my entire summer in video games and mangas. This book will certainly trigger nostalgia for the 80's and early 90's kids as most of the content belonged to that period. I found myself nodding my head to multiple references in the book. The hidden clues, mysteries and the quests were great, simply ingenious. The book highlights the message abut reality and the grievances of establishing a personality in the real world and also about the rising environmental awareness and human's economic greed which leads to massive exploitation of the world's resources. There's great action, ultra high definition scenery depiction and large scale warfare (which mostly occurs in the simulated virtual world of the OASIS). I would like to rant endlessly on the development and creation of OASIS in the novel and how amazing it is but even reviews have character limit so I'll just say this- it amasses galaxies, it's diverse, it' an haven for geeks and nerds, it is vibrant and technological paradise, you can teleport, explore, hunt, savage, loot, level up and even fornicate there. So pretty much everything I dream about.LOL. The ending felt a little off but the Monty Python scene was great. This has been an amazing read. The IOI have been depicted as formidable villanous and scheming capitalistic company which suits the plot very well. A great and amazing reading experience. If there was a sequel, I would be the first in the queue.  Nice Reading.<br/>P.S. - If you love this book, try the movie as well. It's visually stunning and a fantastic adaption.",,,1,0

This phenomenal piece of writing is not only culturally significant but also witty and ambitiously crafted. There's just so much of H2G2 franchise media out there! This book was brilliant right from the beginning. It felt a shorter than I'd expected but it's a trilogy in five parts so there's uch more to come. I'dlik to make it clear that The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy is unlike any other science/Fiction/fantasy book I've ever read and it has aged so well! Full of dramatic dialogues, funny and remarkable characters and laugh out loud narration this feels like the spiritual successor to shows like Rick and Morty, Twilight Zone, Black Mirror and Doctor Who. I have no doubt it has inspired a zillion movie and books. I can only imagine how it broke out in the 1970's with the new wave of modern and Futuristic writing about misadventures in Space. I was hooked right from the beginning. The nhilistic approach was looking over with the end of the Earth occuring very dramatically. There's a lot of elements in the books. Don't even get me started about all the science jokes, the masterfully orchestrated passages which I can only imagine how much long it took to be written. I've never laughed so hard at a book before. It even drops some surprising facts when you least expect it. The world building is done rapidly, humourously and in a sense with which we humans are not entirely acquainted with adding to the delight of the Reading. The names, the characters, the locations and the storyline itself is comedic bought with a hint of Truth and reality lying here and there if you take the effort to notice. The theories and the relationships and the character interact was all so brilliant. This book is very much interactive, a large part of the brain tried to fit the puzzle together and then the entire picture is formed it is awe-struck because it was so much different than what the average reader expected. Also, there's a lost spontaneity throughout the book, it's very much difficult to guess the plot because it happens to have been written randomly and in a state of drunkenness apparently. (This is a complement) The irony and the sarcasm is unmissable and hits the mark every single time, the story and the dialogue defines the expectations and messes with what we perecieve as reality. The space lore and the world building is top notch, unlike anything I've read before. I loved the way Douglas quickly escalated a situation and added comedic interpretations along with a stomach-tightening payoff at the end. I just can't wait to read the next book and the series. Starting off immmidiately. This has been so much fun. Suggested for all intellectuals, people looking for a funny perspective and those interested in Hit hiking the Galaxy, this is a definitive page Turner and perhaps the best book I've read this year.

In fact, The Gospel of Loki introduces a new and unventured area in writing. I've never seen the depiction of Norse Mythology and the Gods in such a way previously. The hardcore rottenness of Loki, the plot building storyline and a wide cast of entertaining characters are surely a few highlights of the book. The most notable and delightful aspect of the novel is undoubtedly, the central character and the narration. Certainly, the author has a clear picture in the mind which she boldly and impressively has brought on the paper. I really adored the quotes on each chapter's heading, trust me, these words of wisdoms will b found nowhere else. I even liked the idea of oracles and prophecies and domains of darkness and light, well, where there's mythology there's bound to be oracles. Anyways, to tel the truth the story is a narration of Loki, the trickster God (most of us will remember the Marvel Avengers' Assemble Supervillain but this one's just rotten to the core, a commendable enemy) and his life's journey. The way Loki speaks, acts and behaves is a hint to what may happen next. His emotions, feelings, moral duties and the dilemmas he faces at every turn are depicted ina  rich and explicit way. The book progresses really well and enthralls the readers. It's witty dialogues, explicit scenes, unbelievable adventures, insight into human (Gods, actually) emotion and second to none humour is notable. Even Thor, Odin, Heimdall and Freya have educated me, their role in the story cannot be disregarded. There's not much action or war but the hateful and injustice ridden Loki will rarely distract you from reading. The quotes are just top notch, very useful if you'd like to insult someone.

There are no throwaway characters; even the smallest conversations that take place have rippling effects on the story as it progresses. No single page in itself is a plot-filler. Taking on this series was a daunting task for me (yes, I have read ASoIaF, half of WoT, some Tchaikovsky, Mistborn, and First Law Trilogy), primarily due to its incredible length, but everything seemed to be fine once I dipped my toes into the first few chapters. In Chapter 2, we get a full-blown battle involving the Moon's Tiste Andii and the cadre of mages involving Tattersail and others. This battle felt like something we usually get in Book 5 of a fantasy series. We are dropped in the middle of all the action, politics, factions, regions, and the influential manipulation of the Godly forces. Death is not as big a deal in Malazan as it is in other cultures. Souls can be rekindled and morphed into different bodies, or even the same bodies, upon the intervention of the gods. The Warrens are the next big thing. I think I get what they are. They sure are the most unique and fresh implementation of a high fantasy magic system. I don't think this book is anything close to Grimdark (mostly because of how much uncanny prose and humorous interaction it has). I was most invested in the first quarter and the last quarter of the book and read the most pages per day during those sections of the book. Kruppe reminds me of Bayaz from The First Law Trilogy. He's one hell of a character, a fantasy anomaly, modelled after none other than other characters from fantasy literature. A matter of fact, every character in the book is more or less a fresh canvas, and not a carbon copy or a tropey rewrite. Can we talk about the landscape, the geography, and the nitty-gritty poetic details of the cinematic locations Erikson hands us? I am fully sold on the rich geographical diversity and epic-ness that will, no doubt, carry over to the following volumes. Amongst my favorite characters from the book are the Bridgeburners, Parran, Lorn, The Jaghut Tyrant, Anomander Rake (big time), Kruppe, and Rallick. The action scenes are very well done. Since Erikson comes from a military background, he writes exceptionally well. The sword fight scenes always had me on the edge of my seat. The mage battles were truly epic in scope, and we got some really cinematic narratives of the large-scale battles that went on sporadically and the ruins that followed. But of course, this review would not be complete if we did not talk about how much of a political shift there has been since Laseen took over the Empire and her schemes to wipe out the old guard. Laseeen is someone who I want a POV for, and it would be a damn shame if we didn't get it. Also, this book has some heavy foreshadowing done through not only the text but also the poems and epigraphs that precede every chapter and the ""book."" I also want to add that all the ""Godly"" intervention and all the scenes in the sword Dragnipur are really surreal. The themes of possession, of manipulating humans and having them as pawns, rebirth, and death are carried over the entire book. Also, the hounds? This is absolutely epic. The power levels in this book are unbelievably good. This was such a joy to read, even if I didn't soak in everything as expected, but I guess that's sort of the point here. I have been told Erikson will namedrop something only to see it take complete form and shape 7000 pages later. What can I say? I was impressed with Gardens of the Moon. It does the pacing right, it does the characters right, and hell, the author even throws us some very poetic prophecies here and there, and the action sequences feel very realistic. The final four chapters of the book were full-blown warfare with dragons, assassins, mages making friends, Dream Manipulation, badass bastard swords, Rake killing everything in sight, escape attempts, and gave a good sense of conclusion after 600 pages. What a start. I am enthralled and I wish to continue onwards, and will be starting with Deadhouse Gates in a couple of days. The things that I wish could have been done better are: well distinguished separation between character POVs, sticking to one major plotline before starting another, having a more descriptive glossary, some more wordplay, and an easier to read (more accessible) prose.",,,1,0

Martin Book Review <br/><br/>  It has almost been a year since I read a Mammoth tome by Geroge R.R. Martin and had forgotten the feeling. Though, this book is unlike any of his previous works, this might just be my most favorite. Honestly, the only reason why I picked this up was to prepare for the prequel HBO GoT Show but I'm stunned. Matter of fact, I cannot imagine HBO adapting this. Not only does the story or rather the saga of the Targaryen Invasion, Rule and Fall in Westerns span for more than 300 years with tons of rebellions, wars, revolts and of course, fire and blood! I had decided that I would seriously read this and digest every single detail, especially from the first half of the book, which is as glorious as it gets. The second half was very well done but had many repetitions and did not look as fresh as the first, maybe because the book just has closely spaced paragraphs, fine print and had more than 750 pages. This is easily the longest book I've read. It took my two months, including  two week long break but it felt really good to turn the final page and let out a breath of relief. The Targaryen's are amazing. They truly are something else. For a fantasy family right now in 2020, the Targaryen's have an entire book based on them. SIde note, I read this as a secondary book while I read some other stuff with a bit more priority as this felt a bit encyclopedic guide/retelling of a novel family's conquest. By the third chapter I was all for it. I was memorizing the names of the Kings, the Queen's(multiple, too many to count), princes, the kingsguard and the revolting Lord's and ladies of Westerns and associated Isles. For a newcomer to the ASOIAF, this is not at all and entry point. I'd like you to read the ASOIAF first and then come back to this to watch how the greatest fictional empire came to be. Now, the style of writing is of course Superior to any other standard fantasy. It has realism, depth, a brute sense of grimness and viciousness. The amount of incest, sodomy, adultery and graphic narration in this can't be stressed enough. The story does cross some boundaries, with extreme aand gross details but I was all in, because this is an unapologetic history of a first noble but later corrupt Empire which ruled Westerns for almost 300 years. The heir/lineage chart at the end of the book is really helpful and assisted me to keep a track of who's who as well as how the story might progress. Now, coming back, the chapters are huge, spanning for almost a hundred pages but telling key events and somewhat fast paced. There's a lot of sadistic humour in the narration, the time flies really fast and George R.R. Martin has planned the book out really well. He has set a timeline of BC and AC(Before and After Aegon, the Conqueror's Conquest) and any other following events are referenced with this timeline. Of course, my favorite Targaryen King is Aegon the Conqueror and then his grandson and then Megor, the brutal brother who would beat away the most fiersome of Gregor, the ""Mountain"" Clegane's attacks. The setup of the book is so good, it smoothly flows from one key events to the other and right from the beginning, the author acquaints the readers with the pattern of the history, the cultural and political influence of the Targaryen reign, the traditions, the inclusion of religion, warfare, conquest and nobility. I personally found the household tales and Mushroom's wildly inappropriate retellings of familial affairs in the book highly entertaining. There are a lot of instances which will make you smile a lot. There will definity be some things that you might want to highlight in the book, especially in the first half which has some great effects on the story later. This chronological approach really helps in the long retelling of the Targaryen Family History. There is no monotonous narration. The author often shifts the subject from kings to the Sept, from conquest to lovemaking, from marriage to affairs, from daughter and sons to knights and bounties, from crowns and Kings to prestigious locations like King's Landing, Casterly Rock, Harrenhall, WInterfell and the Southern Isles. This, in fact is the retelling of e history and the evolution of the entire continent of Westors with the Targaryen House as it's ruler. The tourneys, the champions and the other supernatural stuff also worked out in the book really well. I truly cannot complain about anything. I was just so glad that I could be a part of the great revolution in Westerns and get the second hand experience of how it shaped the future of the ASOIAF saga. This Mammoth of a book is certainly something to remember. Every detail is etched into my mind. I really, really hope that the TV show will do justice to this book. It will have to run for at least 10 seasons with 50 episodes of 1 hour each to actually plot out every single events which occurs here but guess, that's not happening. ANyways, this has been really nice. One thing, this takes a lot of dedication and time but it will really be a smooth reading experience if you are a fan of Martin's work and acquainted with the ASOIAF books/TV series. This was so much fun. Can't wait to brag about it. Wow! Nice Reading....",,,1,0

The description is rich and realistic. Chapter mainly covers some eventful situations and exchange of information.<br/>Tolkien seems to weave reality and fantasy and garb the reader in the silks of Middle Earth.<br/>Immense plot-line and character development. Follows a steady pace. Writing is formal and serious.<br/>Chapter 2: THE PASSING OF THE GREY COMPANY <br/>Tolkien presents a multi-themed chapter which builds up a pace gradually. Writing style is obtained by emotions. Aragorn’s boldness, Eowen’s ladyship and Merry’s servitude are highlighted. A creative and original piece of writing.<br/>Introduction to the dead in the forces of light breaks the orthodox/traditional styles of writing supernatural fantasy.<br/>Chapter 3: THE MUSTER OF ROHAN <br/>An eventful chapter where a lot happens but without any themes or motif. Tolkien does the work of delivering information to the readers about passing events. <br/>I have to admit that Tolkien’s poetic compositions are as good as his prose if not better. <br/>Chapter 4: THE SIEGE OF GONDOR <br/>A fast paced chapter which keeps the reader on the edge of their seats as we get to witness another full scale battle; realistic, thrilling and bloody.<br/>Pippin’s character shows enormous growth . Chapter is well balanced with events as well as the tidings of war. It also highlights the emotional tumult between Faramir and Denethor, Son and Father.<br/>Chapter 5: THE RIDE OF THE ROHIRRIM <br/>Introduction of the Wild Men of the Forest adds a different perspective to the story.<br/>The Rohirrim’s battle fury and energy is portrayed realistically as if the author himself witnessed the events. Very inspiring.<br/>Chapter 6: THE BATTLE OF THE PELENNOR FIELDS <br/>Eowen’s character shows ultimate development. Tolkien may also be empowering women through the LOTR Universe. <br/>The Nazgul lord is a terrifying antagonist for the chapter.<br/>Portrayal of battle is mesmerizing, battle talk is inspiring, songs are enchanting.<br/>Chapter 7: THE PYRE OF DENETHOR<br/> Chapter has a multittude of characters with varied and distinct parsonalties which balances the story and adds flavour to it. <br/>Hope and Despair are highlighted here. <br/>Chapter 8: THE HOUSES OF HEALING<br/> The Lore, Culture, History is blended very well into the story .<br/>Chapter covers the events after the battle, mostly in the house of healing and in-depth description of the healing and treatment methods of LOTR Universe are shown to the readers. Role of Aragron is trasformative. <br/>Reunion of Merry and Pippin lightens the mood of the story and hope prevails.<br/>Chapter 9: THE LAST DEBATE <br/>The council discussion is a recollection of realistic leaders planning strategy. Everything is laid out formally and the story gets too serious to stay a ‘Fantasy’ any longer. <br/>The climax and the end is very near, hinted by Tolkien.<br/>The ‘Dead’ story arc, answers the events happening in the background. Aragorn and Gandlaf continue to dominate my Top tier characters from LOTR Universe. <br/>Chapter 10: THE BLACK GATE OPENS <br/>A final all out war unleashes as Light collides with the darkness. The conclusion is not entirely revealed. <br/>The great battle includes strategic and technical terms. A short and rushed chapter.<br/><br/>BOOK SIX <br/>Chapter 1: THE TOWER OF CIRITH UNGOL<br/> Story continues exactly where it was left off. Chapter mostly includes infiltration and a load of action. Tolkien does not hesitate to thrust the characters in the land of darkness and describe the ghastly conditions there. The physiography is dark and corrupted. <br/>Tolkien pretty much simplifies many things and joins the timeline events together.<br/>Chapter 2: THE LAND OF SHADOW<br/>Chapter is full of huger, thirst, tiredness and fatigue which really annoyed me. The pale and grim physiography of the Land of Mordor does tick the reader off and once it starts getting repetitive it just blows your mind. The conditions of the hobbits are pitiful. Plot seems very repetitive.<br/>Chapter 3: MOUNT DOOM <br/>I hate how Tolkien rants and toils about the suffering of hobbits for almost about 50 pages. It gets very monotonous. <br/>The climax arrives and the action heightens so much as to blow up your mind. The plot twist and a very unexpected ending was incredible.<br/>The prose is weaved together, characters are played like chesspieces and story is perfectly planned throughout.<br/>Chapter 4: THE FIELD OF CORMALLEN <br/>Ah! Finally, at last, the sorrow, death, darkness is over. We are back to the classic evergreen and inspiring narrative. Tolkien certainly does affect the mood of the readers, very influential.<br/>The big reunion, celebration, merriment and well-wishing makes me positively happy and joyful, everything is falling back to normal. Reality and fantasy are blended very well in this crowned gem of fantasy.<br/>Chapter 5: THE STEWARD AND THE KING<br/> This chapter marks multiple happy endings for several characters, the ending was very satisfactory. It’s another way of Tolkien boasting and finally uniting all the elementary factors of the LOTR Universe one last time.<br/>The romances of Farmair and Eowen as well as Arwen and Aragorn also portray the essential ‘Love Life’ and ‘Romance’ embedded in LOTR Universe.<br/>Poems, songs are delightfully written and do bring a smile on my face.<br/>Chapter 6: MANY PARTINGS <br/>In a book with 1000+ pages of quests, battles, world building and character development consider 200 pages to be post quest writing which provides a perfect ending/climax. Tolkien is through with everything he does, even if the conclusion of the story takes 6 whole chapters.<br/>Tolkien writes about joy, love, positivism and the eternal bond between characters and many events involved which pleases the readers and sets the mood right. A heartwarming chapter with emotional appeal.<br/>Chapter 7: HOMEWARD BOUND <br/>To look at the bigger picture, the concluding chapter deals with all the characters slowly settling down after the great storm and now it’s the hobbits’ turn. It’s wonderful to see the hobbits retrace their way back to the Shire and bidding farewell to primary locations; my brain is flooded with memories of their first journey across the Middle Earth. <br/>Bree story arc was entertaining, the primary motive of the chapter is to convey that the quest ended peacefully and how the characters changed from the experience.<br/>Chapter 8: THE SCOURING OF THE SHIRE <br/>The most surprising chapter of all. It acts like a side quest. (Just like I video games)<br/>It reflects in stark contrast how the smaller quests look as compared to the War of the Ring. Saruman’s return and death were totally unexpected but a deserving end to the tale. The Uprising at the Shire was entertaining with a bit of action and heated conversation demonstrating Hobbits’ love for their homeland.<br/>Most notable detail is Frodo’s maturity and wisdom.<br/>Chapter 9: THE GREY HAVENS<br/>I can’t believe it’s finally done. Such a legendary piece of fantasy writing is over…. a truly well-deserved ending to a great and a legendary tale which will be memorable, at least for me it will. The chapter uplifts you and if you were a LOTR bud while you started reading #TFOTR, by the end of the chapter you surely must have blossomed into a LOTR expert.<br/>I’m happy for Sam and the Shire life comforts me a lot.<br/>Frodo’s decisions and breaking of the fellowship were indeed a plot twist but nonetheless made for a perfect conclusion.<br/>I feel blessed to have read this epic fantasy, a heartwarming tale, very touching! I found hundreds of quotes, which have hidden wisdom in them are are truly inspiring. <br/>",,,1,0

A complete thriller. The forest is magical and the idea of living trees is absolutely original. <br/>P.S. These ideas and concepts related to fantasy writing are evident and popularly recognized today but it should be noted that ‘Tolkien’s Legendarium’ initiated the spread of spread of authentic modern fantasy.<br/>*Tolkien often uses impressive figures of speech, metaphors and exclamations. Secondary characters start appearing out of the blue.<br/>*The poetry and rhymes are well-crafted and obtained by feelings. <br/>CHAPTER 7: IN THE HOUSE OF TOM BOMBADIL <br/>Chapter has numerous themes in it and is particularly different from the general storyline.<br/>Tolkien clearly wants to enrich the world-building and thus adds a variety of dimensions to it - philosophical, wonder, intellectual.<br/>Surely, the dreams of Hobbit have some kind of hidden meaning, foreshadowing maybe. <br/>The chapter focuses more on the narration and description of the ‘Old Forest’ and the natural world beyond borders of the Shire.<br/>Tom and Goldberry’s house portrays the culture of the folks in the Middle Earth and warms up the readers to explore multitude of journeys and experiences yet to come in Frodo’s adventure.<br/>Poetry is a connecting link.<br/>CHAPTER 8: FOG ON THE BARROW-DOWNS <br/>Very eventful chapter, Tolkien also has a recognizable skill to scare the readers and is the master of horror in a true sense.<br/>Chapter marks Tom Bombadill as an important character.<br/>Each chapter focuses on a particular region/area from the Middle earth and provides in-depth information about it’s specialty and uniqueness.<br/>Tolkien's poems provide deeper insight and appeases the readers. Goldberry’s description is rich and pure. <br/>CHAPTER 9: AT THE SIGN OF THE PRANCING PONY<br/>The theme of the story changes yet again. Rural bliss is narrated perfectly. Tolkien has a powerful imagination backed up by this remarkable writing style as well as the extensive research and travels; he weaves words and produces amazing characters which seem utterly real.<br/>The story starts building up steadily as the characters realize and discuss their goals and conflicts.<br/>Tolkien also delivers the unexpected and the suspense keeps up on mounting. A notable and an interesting chapter.<br/>Scenes inside the Prancing Pony Inn are laid out perfectly. P.S I’m starting to miss Gandalf, the Wizard at this point.  <br/>CHAPTER 10: STRIDER <br/>A new primary character’s entrance is unexpected and numerous notable events begin to happen. All the characters are sedentary at Bree.<br/>The conflict with the Riders feels desperate and the situations worsen.<br/>Emotions of characters are played with giving the characters premonitions regarding the possible events in future.<br/>Narration is full of suspense and still groundbreakingly simple. The story is developing with multiple layers.<br/>CHAPTER 11: A KNIFE IN THE DARK <br/>The climax builds up, chilling and terrifying.<br/>Strider’s character development is very strong and you can’t help noticing it.<br/>A ‘History Lesson’ regarding Middle Earth’s Lore adds yet another dimesion to the masterpiece.<br/>Journey of the natural world is described enticingly and richly.<br/>CHAPTER 12: FLIGHT TO THE FORD <br/>The concluding chapter in the first book marks the milestone in LOTR Story.<br/>New characters continue to be introduced; all memorable, unique and original possessing skills and attributes unlike anyone else.<br/>Frodo’s character development is eminent; his bribery and burning anger, relation with the ring and and hatred/fear towards the Riders.

All questions are answered in a crystal clear manner, more than necessary to tell the truth. In a nutshell, chapter provides a vivid description of new characters , thoughts and probable events in the future.<br/>Tolkien’s narration through multiple characters speaks strongly about how the author has put in so much effort to develop amazing and realistic characters and a foolproof story. The picture is quite clear.<br/>The end of the chapter does put a smile on my face. <br/>CHAPTER 3: THE RING GOES SOUTH <br/>Tolkien wants to narrate each event in depth and thus chapters become excessively big.<br/>Resistances, an almost impossible quest and obstacles make the story crawling at snails pace. <br/>Tolkien delivers information about Physiography of Middle Earth in an article like form.<br/>All members of the Fellowship comment on issues and increase character development, story, etc. <br/>CHAPTER 4: A JOURNEY IN THE DARK<br/>Bam! We’re back into action (and a lot of travelling…) Tolkien provides a bone-chilling narrative by setting up a dark and grim atmosphere.<br/>Moria, Khazad Dum are some other remarkable locations in the LOTR Universe with a song, backstory,etc. <br/>Gandalf is the central figure and here to stay throughout the series. He is portrayed shrewd, old, wise and ‘Magical’. <br/>CHAPTER 5: THE BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DÛM <br/>Tolkien creates an indeliable expression of fear, horror, grief, action and victory in the readers mind by twisting and turning the story in the most interesting manner.<br/>The atmosphere at Khazad Dum Bridge and Mines of Moria is dark and grim, a wonderful arena for a legendary battle.<br/>The fight scenes are perfect with new and formidable ranks of enemies emerging and Tolkien’s imaginative writing makes the story appear in front of us. Nothing less than the experience of watching a live-action movie. <br/>CHAPTER 6: LOTHLÓRIEN<br/>The passing of Gandalf does influence the characters and the storyline, everything seems much less fun now. A gloom of despair hangs in the air.<br/>Tolkien adds yet another 1000+word description location- Lothlorien and there’s a whole lot of journey covered throughout the chapter. Sometimes, too much details are expressed.<br/>The first half of the chapter focuses on location and character development and the second half of the chapter introduces many secondary characters. Chapter has mixed themes. <br/>CHAPTER 7: THE MIRROR OF GALADRIEL <br/>Offbeat chapter, Tolkien wishes to demonstrate something never seen before. The style of writing is one of it’s kind which has hidden clues and references throughout the timeline.<br/>Undoubtedly the entire chapter is dedicated to Galadriel. The slow story mesmerizes the reader and imbibes an unidentifiable/inexpressible emotion within their heart.<br/>CHAPTER 8: FAREWELL TO LÓRIEN <br/>Chess pieces are laid out, time to get into real action. Final decisions are takes. Goals/aim/path of the Fellowship appear crystal clear. <br/>Character development of Galdriel, Frodo and Gimli heightens.<br/>Chapter is all about emotions; focuses on farewell, goodwill, peace that leaves you with a long lasting lust for joy. <br/>The Gift Distribution ceremony is apt and entertaining, dialogues are written with great prudence and thought. <br/>CHAPTER 9: THE GREAT RIVER <br/>Tolkien gives too much info about trees, rocks, weather, climate, hills, lakes, etc. As if to attempt extensive text(-tification) of the huge map of the Middle earth.<br/>Characters seem weary and exhausted as the climax draws near with subtle devleopment signs. Full of Revelations.<br/>It’s interesting how Tolkien instantly changes a peaceful situation into a threateningly sequences full of action and orc attacks.<br/>CHAPTER 10: THE BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP<br/>An extravagant chapter as a whole, Ultimate and reckoning. <br/>Frodo’s vision are shaking and the dreadful Land of Morgoth & Minas Morgul is described ingeniously. <br/>Many conflicts and extreme situations are portrayed. Final choices are made and unexpected yet sadly surprising events unfold.<br/>The climax is oddly satisfying yet I’m just done with 1/3rd of LOTR Universe. The world is rapidly building, the narration style just topples high fantasy. Powerful, original, engaging work of High Fantasy.",,,1,0

Many shocking and surprising events occur. <br/>Strider undoubtedly becomes a major character and equipped with incredible skills, he inspires and continues to lead. <br/>Boromir’s death is addressed and many questions are resolved. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas have a firm resolve.  <br/>CHAPTER 2: THE RIDERS OF ROHAN <br/>Tolkien introduces another important location- Rohan,  Minas Tirith and Gondor in the southern lands and excels at world building with unique characters, soldiers and monarchs laid out in array. <br/>LOTR will now have separate character narratives as multiple characters are located at various places. Saruman is the primary antagonist. <br/>The journeys and travelling seems too long and lengthy, even in words. A situation is developed.

Readers get a jist of court politics, brainwashing, etc.<br/>An undeliable message of how important secondary characters are influence the storyline.<br/>A chapter full of energy, positivism and spirit.  <br/>CHAPTER 7: HELM’S DEEP <br/>A full scale battle scene takes place which is well balanced, entertaining as well as practically realistic.<br/>The downfall and uprising of both the forces is portrayed. A lot of blood, gore and violence.<br/>CHAPTER 8: THE ROAD TO ISENGARD<br/>Immense character development, Gimli and Legolas’s part with in-depth description of Fangorn Forest and Caverns of Helm’s Deep. <br/>The plot moves slowly but powerfully, hidden motives are unveiled.<br/>The adverse effects of Industrialization are beautifully portrayed in the story.<br/>The reunion of the fellowship is amusing. <br/>CHAPTER 9: FLOTSAM AND JETSAM <br/>An average chapter with another full scale battle. I really liked nothing other than Pippin’s narrations and backstory. The chapter conclusion is noticeable. <br/>CHAPTER 10: THE VOICE OF SARUMAN <br/>Tolkien blends awesome characters, wonderful locations, mind-blowing dialogues and anticipates scenarios to deliver great content.<br/>The clash of wizards was a great scene for me. Highlights faith, power, loyalty, benevolence. Appealing climax.<br/>CHAPTER 11: THE PALANTÍR <br/>Almost everything about this chapter is interesting. The suspense builds up and soon it unleashes many surprises.<br/>The idea of a ‘Palantir’ is exceptional.<br/>I was thrust into a very accelerated storyline suddenly. A delightful reading experience.<br/>BOOK FOUR <br/>CHAPTER 1: THE TAMING OF SMÉAGOL<br/>Introduction to Gollum was very essential. Narrative switches to Sam and Frodo in the Dark Lands of the South. Tolkien has laid out a vast universe which seems to come together and give a bigger picture. Gollum’s character is unique and pitiful. We get to see the other side of multiple characters.<br/>Gollum is merciless and horrible. <br/>CHAPTER 2: THE PASSAGE OF THE MARSHES <br/>Gollum’s character development is rapid and a new class of antagonist, unique and original and terrifying.<br/>Many unseen/invisible obstacles prevent Frodo and Sam from moving on. The Ring stars showing it’s dark powers. This setup by the author is unique and attractive.<br/>CHAPTER 3: THE BLACK GATE IS CLOSED <br/>Recurring primary characters have a different attitude due to the events that occurred in the past.<br/>The portrayal of the Dark lands of Mordor is convincingly grim, dark and haunting. Tolkien slowly makes sure that the reader absorbs every bit of information about the Middle Earth Universe.  <br/>CHAPTER 4: OF HERBS AND STEWED RABBIT <br/>Almost no significant events occur yet the sudden change in landscape lightens the nature off the story.<br/>Sam and Gollum’s relation foreshadows their future. I have started beginning to see these characters from a completely different perspective. <br/>Tolkien has put many fancy botanical terms that ridiculed me, The appearance of Farmir is totally unexpected. <br/>CHAPTER 5: THE WINDOW ON THE WEST<br/> A chapter thats all about talk and less about action, though nonetheless engaging and connecting the past and the present. Throwback-Boromir, History of the Stewards of Rohan, etc. <br/>A load of issues are discussed, known and unknown, news is passed from person to person. Chapter acts like a recap of the recent events. <br/>CHAPTER 6: THE FORBIDDEN POOL <br/>This reminds me much of the ‘Kingsroad’ episode from GoT as events happening here completely outline those. Emotion, Care, Faith, Loyalty and other related emotions are highlighted. The idea of the ‘ Floating Bodies’ in the pool is truly haunting. Gollum is the central character. <br/>Farmir’s revelation about Cirith Ungol is menacing.<br/>CHAPTER 7: JOURNEY TO THE CROSS-ROADS <br/>A mystery hangs in the air. <br/>Some foreshadowing ‘Easter Eggs’ are hidden between the lines. <br/>Mostly description of short journey, the Dark Journey and the blossoming characters.<br/>CHAPTER 8: THE STAIRS OF CIRITH UNGOL <br/>This chapter holds the readers attention and provides a visual treat as if the words jump right out of the book and form a cinematic image. Narration is simply perfect. <br/>Gollum’s ulterior motives which I suspected very much surface. A sudden change of events makes the story much more interesting and breaks the monotonous plot. <br/>The storybook talk between Sam and Frodo lighten the mood, atmosphere and positivism. The ‘black riders’ appearance at the beginning is chilling and memorable.<br/>CHAPTER 9: SHELOB’S LAIR<br/> A chapter full of action, fear and darkness. <br/>The first half of the chapter prepares the readers for a thrill and bam! It just smashes the reader with it’s bombastic and thrilling action sequence with the appearance of the beastly Shelob spider demon and fight in the dark when they least expect it. Story takes a surprising sharp turn.<br/>CHAPTER 10: THE CHOICES OF MASTER SAMWISE<br/>A very important, notable chapter delivering great content along with exceptional style of writing. Sam’s heroic feat was unexpected. Tolkien brings out the best in the characters at times of need when direly required. <br/>The cliffhanger is mind-blowing….Can’t wait to get my hands on the next book. The chapter has well balanced emotions and action.",,,1,0

He has the banner, he has one power, and he has the armies of Artur Hawkwing fighting at his side. Everything is falling into place but mentally Rand is not yet ready to take the mantle that has been thrust upon him, and so he runs with Perrin, Moiraine, Lan and Loial hot on his heels. Dying from the sickness of Shadar Logoth, Mat is rushed to Tar Valon by Egwene, Elaine and Nynaeve, only something sinister is happening at the White Tower as whispers of the Black Ajah prove to be more than just rumours.<br/><br/>This is the first time we really see Jordan doing what he does best, juggling multiple points of view as his characters start to travel along diverging plot paths. As the characters start branching out you start to really get an appreciation for the sheer magnitude of the story that Jordan wants to tell, and you get that lingering feeling that it may be a long time before some of these characters cross paths again. The story is not as self contained as The Great Hunt, and if you strip back a lot of the character and world building, not a lot actually happens in this book, but what this book does really well is position all the pieces where they need to be for the rest of the series, preparing them with small scenarios where their actions subtlely contribute to the overaching plot.<br/><br/>The big changes in this book that you can see right from the start is that each viewpoint character is starting to get their own clearly defined quest, rather than just playing the support role to Rand's quest. Despite the title of the book, we hardly get a chapter with Rand as the point of view character as Jordan starts to flesh out Mat, Perrin, Egwene and Nynaeve as main characters in their own right. I'm glad that we finally get the real Mat back in this book, his happy go lucky nature was sorely missed in The Great Hunt, and I like seeing how the memories of the past first started to manifest in Mat's psyche. Perrin does the most growing up in this book, and I'm glad to see him leave his whiny personality behind from the first two books to become a likeable, respectable, and formidable hero. Egwene and Elaine are starting to show that they are willing to leave their childish bickering behind, but Nynaeve is real disappointment in this book, reverting back to ignorant and annoying village girl after being the strongest character from the first two books.<br/><br/>All in all, The Dragon Reborn is an excellent addition to the series, and one that finally sees the scope of this adventure become truly epic. By distancing the reader from Rand during this book, Jordan made his initial descent into madness all the more apparent, and I think what Jordan does here makes Rand far more sympathetic when he truly descends into madness in the later books. Having the characters finally start to grow up makes this book a lot more enjoyable for me, and I start to see why I looked back on these books with such fondness",,,1,0

The story starts a month or so after the event of the Eye of the World. Rand has his first encounter with the Amyrlin Seat and all manner of fun ensues.<br/><br/>Padan Fain leads the way for the bad guys in this novel; his character over the series that I love, an absolute nut job, reading his scenes is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine. What Jordan does with Fain is show that the story arc is never going to be black and white, but all shade of grey as well. Like the Eye of the World, this book builds up to a main turning point, something sadly lacking later in the series.<br/><br/>The way in which introduces new characters is always varied from rumours to acquaintances, something that he tends to do very well, and in all fairness he needs to, like the first book we are introduced to even more characters, some who will fall by the wayside but not forgotten and some with become catalyst and agonists for future storylines.<br/><br/>This book starts to get the main players for future books into the story, from the strange invaders from across the Aryth Ocean and the Black Ajah to Mat and Perrin stepping up to the forefront of events.<br/><br/>Overall this a wonderful second book, much like the first and definitely a must read for all fantasy fans.",,,1,0

The Wheel of Time is an Epic Fantasy Series of a grand scale, beyond the scope of any other fantasy series currently in the works. Sprawling across fourteen books, the Wheel of Time tales the story of The Ages and the age-old battle of the Light and the Dark. I was drawn into the series instantly having read just the first chapter, captivated not only by the prose but the ambitious undertaking by the revered Robert Jordan. I will be reviewing this book based on character arcs and plot points as dictated by its enormous page count and intricately detailed world-building<br/>  The prologue features some of the most epic and stylistic high fantasy narration with sprawled and richly detailed scenery and bombardment of lots of in-world terminologies such as the Dragon Reborn, The Age of Madness, The One True Power, The Maddening and formation of Dragonmount, etc. It awakens the readers about nature as well as the style of this ambitious series. I highly enjoyed this and read this twice just to get the right perspective. A lot of uninitiated readers might be thrown off with how vast and detailed the prologue itself is but rereading it will set you to ease. Numerous things from here are referenced ahead as well and this part of the story definitely sets the tone for the rest of the book.<br/>   The story opens with Rand'al Thor and Tam in the secluded farmland of the Two Rivers. The stylistic prose and the rich descriptions of the location drew me in. Within the first couple of chapters, we meet about twenty characters, most of them minor but the others noticeably major. These first couple chapters leave a lot to think about and ponder over for the readers. I was enchanted and drawn into the intricacies, the culture and the perspective of the dwellers about the world outside the village boundaries. The festival of Bel Tine really works well to send the message about just how grand and invigorating this story is going to be. Of course, by the first five chapters, the introduction is solid as Egwene, Rand, Mat, Perrin, Nynaeve, Lan and Moiraine have been employed into the story a lot. Even though it may feel like a slow start, I would never complain that no developments occurred. A lot of foreshadowing and cultural descriptions can be found in these chapters itself. When the Trollocs attacked Rand's home I was on the edge of my seat and completely drawn into the story. Robert Jordan does not hesitate to explore various themes and long drawn out rich descriptions of the villagers while adding depth and action to the story as well. Even history lessons and speeches from Moiraine had all my attention.<br/>  I was fascinated by the whole Aes Sedai affair. An enormous amount of in-world terminology is thrown about at every single page, I kid you not. The glossary itself is about fifty pages long and rightfully so. Rand's anxious approach to Moiraine and the villager's response to the Trolllock attack crafts them into a three-dimensional character.  While all this happened, in the background a darker shadow always loomed-may it be the Myrddrall, the ravens or the talk of the Dark One being no longer bound to Shayol Ghul. <br/>    By this point, all the major characters very much acquainted with each other and go along very well. There is quite a lot of diversity with such a bi and intriguing cast of characters till Jordan does not shy from delivering into each of their minds and telling the readers about their interesting takes on almost each and every scenario that they are faced with. Also, we spend a lot of time seeing them travel and cross rivers and evade dangers skilfully so yes, this part was highly entertaining as we got to the chemistry and the character associations. The whole Aes Sedai thing is always on, where Rand and Mat draw suspicion from the advice of the several secondary chapters. Also, the actual part where the making of a hero has been initiated when Ran was gifted the heron blade by his supposed father, which we also discover might be a lie. At Baerlon, the children of the Light are a major attraction and I was blown away by how descriptive and innovate the writer can be by introducing us to numerous prophecies, histories, geographical background, political scheming, skirmishes across Andar and the role of the wielders of the One Source.  Morianine and Lan are easily the highlights of the story and their characters get a lot of depth along with Nynaeve and Egwene who are not only womanly but make fantastic companions. The overlooming danger is still evident with eh Trollocs and the Fade on their heels. This arc introduces a lot of fo themes, geography, locations, secondary characters, perspectives and thrills to the story and gives it the momentum necessary to move towards the action scenes. The reaction of Mat, Rand and Perrin as they set out of adventure and tackle the minions of the ar One is an exciting journey to follow and read. Every chapter hints prophecies and foreshadows multiple events but more than this, it raises questions and mysteries which excite the readers as to how the world and magic system works. Most of the stuff isn't even answered until the end f the book but I kept an eye out and read the chapter summaries on Tar Valon Library as well so I knew better than o just skip these intricacies and small details that characters plan out in an organic manner. In Bearlon, we notice innkeepers, a few songs, Min and several common folks which add to the depth of the world-building and fascinate the readers. Shadar Logoth is a fascinating chapter that introduced the Lore, some history, background and character relations very well while changing the theme of the story for a short while. Mat, Perrina and Rands misadventures the treasure hunt and the meeting with Mordeth are horrifying in addition to the consistently harrowing dreams of Balze'mmon. Moiraine takes the lead and her concern for the lads is conveyed in a very believable manner. At this point, herbs, crafts, items of magic, the religion and faith of the people in Andar as well as the Evils of the Dark One are highlighted and brought to attention. I had a great time going through this arc. <br/>  There is a lot of stuff to unpack here and taking notes would be a great idea whenever you feel tome foreshadowing or hinting is done as this series sprawls over eleven thousand pages. The thrill and the scariness of the story are evident but what amazed me more was how each of the characters dealt with the others and the situation. <br/>   Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become a legend.”<br/>The Eye Of The World: Page 1<br/><br/>The Eye of the World is the first book of the fourteen book Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. This thrilling series begins in Emond’s Field, where we meet Rand al’Thor, Mat Cauthon, and Perrin Aybara. While preparing for Winternight, two travellers arrive to the village; a guard and a noble lady—or so it seems. The guard and noblewoman are, in fact a warder and Aes Sedai respectively. Following an attack on the village by a band of Trollocs, Rand, Mat, and Perrin must embark on a quest to find answers as to why their quiet village was attacked by beasts thought to only exist in legend. Along with them in this quest are Moiraine Sedai, Lan the Warder, the gleeman Thom Merrillin, Egwane al’Vere, as well as the village Wisdom Nynaeve al’Meara, who join the boys to fight the Dark One and prevent his plans from coming to fruition.<br/><br/>The journey is long and filled with peril and unforeseen obstacles. The group is tracked by Trollocks, Fades, and Darkfriends, managing to stay one-step ahead until they are forced apart at Shadar Logath. Eventually, the friends are reunited at Camelyn, where Loial the Ogier joins the group. Together, they journey onward to the Eye of the World and hopefully to thwart the Dark One’s plans.<br/>That being said, I would urge you to continue reading as it picks up the pace around a quarter of the way through. While the plot definitely has the familiar tropes of high fantasy novels, and as a result, there are a few similarities that can be seen in other works within the genre, this is largely due to the huge impact The Wheel of Time series had on the genre. Jordan’s skilful writing truly brings the characters and their journey to life. My favourite character was, without a doubt Nynaeve, with Moiraine Sedai closely behind.<br/><br/>Robert Jordan sets the foundation for a saga filled with unforgettable characters and a world steeped in rich history and legend. If you truly love the fantasy genre, passing up a chance to read The Eye of the World would be an unbelievable mistake.<br/><br/>Life in Emond's Field has been pretty boring for Rand Al'Thor and his friends until a strange young woman arrives in their village. Moraine is an Aes Sedai, a magician with the ability to wield the One Power, and she brings warnings of a terrible evil awakening in the world. That very night, the village is attacked by bloodthirsty Trollocs - a fearsome tribe of beast-men thought to be no more than a myth. As Emond's Field burns, Moraine and her warrior-guardian help Rand and his companions to escape. But it is only the beginning of their troubles. For Moraine believes Rand Al'Thor is the Dragon Reborn, and that he is fated to unite the world against the rising darkness and lead the fight against a being so powerful and evil it is known simply as the Dark One.<br/><br/>The Eye of the World marks the beginning of Robert Jordan’s twelve-book epic fantasy series The Wheel of Time. This series is regarded as the finest fantasy series ever by many of Jordan’s loyal fans and many years of a reader’s life can be lost within its pages.<br/><br/>At a time when many authors were producing pastiche Tolkien, Jordan created entirely new races, an innovative magical system and a captivating world with its own rich history.<br/><br/>The Eye of the World is a multifaceted and exhilarating adventure from an accomplished writer; a fantasy book that grips slowly and refuses to let go.",,,1,0

Septimus Heap is back again from time(as we saw in the previous book) and with much more Physik and Magyikal Knowledge and this time he's the hunter, not the hunter. Much like the other books we get to see more secondary chararchters like Jillie Djinn, Marcellus Pye, Snorri, Ephaniah, the rat man, The Thing and Merton Meredith a ""Darke"" prodigy, the Wendron witches. The House of Foryx and the Manuscriptorium are new locations found in the book which are visited frequently. I read this book in straight four days even though its sheer size. Septimus, Jenna, and Beetle (Who can be recognized as a major character in this book) have grown and developed greatly. The illustrations are eye catching and I liked Merrin Meredith, ex apprentice of the Dark Necromancer be in control of the Darker ring and try to be independent. It gives a great kick start to the book and fives it a somewhat Dark touch. Merrins Illustrations are nice too, and I think that he, too is a character who isn't treated fair from the beginning of the series. The main aim of the book is to rescue Nicko Heap who is lost back in time and also to fulfill the Quests that Septimus accidental picked up, though it seems to be a secondary aim. Spit Fyre is rapidly growing and Marcia seems truly caring about Septimes throughout the book. The queste is very obvious and seems to easy and at the same location at the House of Forty, its like two aims and one destination. The cold winds, The Darker Thing, Illusions, lost maps, crssing narrow bridges and escaping witches are some difficult conditions that our heroes have to face. Beetle plays an imlortant role, especially with Jenna and Septimus in the book. I missed Nicko and Snorri and Im realizing now how much Sage has described and plotted Ullr, Snorris cat and how she helps the team though the reader doesnt realize it much. Better than Flyte and Physik but a bit below than Magyk. Nice Read. Plot Queste takes Septimus, Jenna and Beetle in search of Nicko and Snorri, to bring them back from the past. They go to Marcellus Pye, who has remembered some information from his 500 year old memory and provides them with some notes from Nicko and Snorri. The notes say that they planned to travel to the House Of Foryx where all times meet, and there they expected to come back to their time. Jenna takes the notes back with her to the Palace. In the meantime, Merrin Meredith travels to the Castle in hope of destroying Septimus. He bumps into Jenna who drops all the notes of Nicko and Snorri, they get wet. Jenna goes to the The Manuscriptorium and asks Beetle to help her RePlace the notes. Beetle then takes her to the restoration specialist Ephaniah Grebe. Ephaniah is a half man half rat being. He Restores the pages and binds them in to a book. But they still missed one piece, the centre of the map to the House of Foryx. Merrin has in the meantime, takes the job of a scribe in the Manuscriptorium. There he meets the ghost of Tertius Fume, the first Chief Hermetic Scribe. Tertius makes him transfer the loyalty of the Thing to him and assures that he will send Septimus on a perilous Queste. Tertius Fume arrives at the Wizard Tower along with the ghosts of all the previous ExtraOrdinary Wizards and announces that they are about to draw the Questing stone. Septimus feels a Darkenesse inside the urn where the stone is kept and tells that a Thing is there to sabotage the draw. They escape the Wizard tower as Tertius Fume puts it under Siege. But accidentally Septimus takes the Questing stone, thinking it to be a KeepSafe. Septimus, Jenna and Beetle start their journey to the House of Foryx. Sam Heap shows them the way. They eventually reach the House and find Ephaniah near it. He had found the last missing piece of the map but was possessed by the Thing. Septimus, Jenna and Beetle enter the House of Foryx, but accidentally all three of them go inside. There Septimus is taken inside a door by a girl and Septimus finds himself face to face with Hotep-Ra, first ExtraOrdinary wizard. In the meantime Jenna and Beetle find Nicko and Snorri and all of them try to escape the House of Foryx. Just as they were about to leave, Marcia and Sarah arrive outside the house on Spit Fyre, so all of them are able to return to their own time.",,,1,0

I read the paperback edition of the book sometimes switching to Ebook and ended up reading it in five days and giving it a straight five star. This book has been so well written and planned that I can barely find any flaw and its better than the previous books in the series and much like Magyk. Angie extends the Magyk Universe discovering new haunted Islands and introducing new maps and locations to the reader. These locations have a unique climate and changes the mood of characters in the book like Cattrock Light, The Peele, Sand Dunes, Star Island,etc. Also sage introduces two new ship namely Cerys and Marauder in the book and they have a lot of Pirat-ish things in common. The character development is very well and the secondary characters many of them which are new like Jim Knee, Linda, Syrah Stars(My favorite), Miarr, Jack, Theodolite, Barney Pot, etc have been introduced with their own particular story and nature and a fixed behaviour and speech which makes the reader indulge band enjoy these characters heartily. Septimus, Beetle, Milo, Lucy, Wolf Boy, Jenna, Nicko can be considered as a major characters who have grown a lot. Septimus has been awarded his Senior Apprentice and this marks the series coming to its midway. Even the plotlines of Jenna, Wolfboy, Lucy were not at all boring. Here, the author tries to introduce a lot of new things in the magical world skipping all the previously important landmarks and characters like the Castle, Marfan Marshes, Simon, Zelda, Marcia, Silas, Sarah, Merrin. I love the Grim Feeding Part and find it very funny and horrifying at the same time. Even the bind between Spit Fyre and Septimus is clearly and particularly explained in the earlier chapters. There is a a closeness and sometimes argument between the major characters. The Pigeon Post was also excellent. The Syren and the Syarh Syara part is the one which amazes and wonders me in the most in the book. It is delicate and a bit horror and emotional for to reader. Septimus reacts to things and events in the book very naturally. Milos new band and Theodolite's new band in the book is well portrayed. I was very shocked as the final plot was revealed which included that Fume has allied with the Syren to destroy the castle and do blue bluffing Milo to capture warrior Jinnies and transport them through the underground ice tunnels. The ending will be understood by the person who has involvingly  read the first four books. The character Jim Knee is the real spotlight as he is dramatic, Humorous, and wary. <br/>I would strongly recommend this book to every Magical Genre reader with a great twist. It involves potions, charms, chants, safeguards, Jinnies, Dragons, Haunted Islands, Spirited Souls, Pirates, Ghosts, Wizards, Cat-Man, And a load of great heroes and villains that will be sure to entertain you. The descriptive Nature of Sage of various locations and landmarks is at the epitome and paramount here, reaching its highest potential and giving the reader a world full of fantasy and beyond imagination and also teaching him about how to interact with people and understand and help them. A truly great and fantastic Read.!!!<br/>Plot",,,1,0

This book is budding with a whole new lot of secondary characters, a lot of them, playing their role in the Magykal world. Then, there's the Dragon Spit Fyre to which I looked forward to and then there's Simon Heap, the betraying cousin of Jenna who ressurcts Dom Daniel, villain of the previous book. This book is not as quite as upto mark as the first one and I really miss the Marshes and the atmosphere there. The first half of the book is great, totally great but after it it begins to fade a bit. Simon can be considered from now on as a major character. Obviously, Angie Sage is an expert in character development and human anatomy and understanding and conveying the reader the emotions of young Children. I liked the captivity part of Jenna(The Chocolate Charm, especially) but after half the book it gets dull, though Septimus remains interesting. Also recruiting the Ex villain again just in the next book is not very cool. New charms, books, creatures, Magyk methods, Castle places, Characters are a major improvement in the series. Sage is very particular about parentage, in this book Jenna's father is revealed as Septimus' was in the earlier book. Mysteries keep unfolding every where and its really nice to see and experience TBS characters grow and improve their abilities. I hated the Dragon Boat Part and those misleading boat repairs. I loved the captivity, Shadow, Escape, Into the Forest, Discovering Boy 409 A.K.A Wolf Boy, Banishing Simon, Destruction of Dom Daniel Parts. Interesting and mysterious book. Strongly recommended to Magyk readers. I notice that Sage focuses many times on unnecessary points confusing the reader, especially in the early chapters, but still it was worth a 3.5 out of 5. Check the plot:-<br/> When Simon kidnaps Jenna, Septimus goes out to search for her. He is assisted in his search by his friend Beetle. But Jenna runs away from Simon's observatory in The Badlands and makes her way towards The Port. Eventually Septimus is able to rescue Jenna with Nicko's help from the Port but they are tracked by Sleuth, Simon's tracking ball.<br/><br/>They make their way to the Marram Marshes where they take the Dragon-Boat from Aunt Zelda's cottage and fly her to the Castle. But they meet Simon, flying in the sky. Simon drops a huge Thunderflash on the Dragon-Boat and it drops over Jannit Maarten's Boatyard. Septimus, Jenna and Aunt Zelda are able to revive her through the Transubstantiate Triplet spell.<br/>Septimus is also in search of the long lost Flyte charm. He finds the separated charm and unites it along with the small arrow Flyte charm that Marcia had given him. Eventually he is able to fly and even warns Simon never to harm Jenna again. Also, the rock that Jenna gave him at Aunt Zelda's cottage turns out to be the egg of a dragon and eventually it hatches. Septimus absolutely adores the dragon and names him Spit Fyre. The dragon for some strange reason identifies Marcia as his mummy, much to Marcia's annoyance.<br/>Septimus also rescues Marcia by identifying the shadow that has been trailing her. He also finds out that the ShadowSafe Marcia is developing contains, unbeknownst to her, the bones of destroyed Necromancer DomDaniel, which, once reassembled, try to kill Marcia. With Septimus's help, Marcia is able to Identify him and he is once again destroyed.",,,1,0

(Magykal of course!) There are about 20 charachters, only seven of them major. They have interesting and widely differing personalities, each of them unique in some or the other skills. Several children, a powerful wizard, a ""Darke"" Necromancer, A worrying father and an army Expendable boy, Seventh of a seventh are some examples. The somewhat formidable character is the Hunter, is better than the main Antagonist. This book not only has Magykal people but also relics and beasts like the Bogart, self transforming Ducks, wide variety of potions, spells and charms, amulets, dragon rings and boats, fairytale legend and a lot more. The writer has set the story at various interesting locations, each of them unique with a well defined atmosphere. The way Angie highlights the magical words is capturing. There re a few similarities from the Spooks Similarities. Like seventh son, pointy shoes, Apprentice, etc.The book also has a funny side and is lighter and meant for younger reader. It does not really have the ""Dark Complexion"" that I like and is not at all very horror, which are its setbacks. But it is full of plot changes, twists and turn, filled with mystery and do not follow a general plotline. It is also very interesting to see how characters, especially the young ones interact with one another. I give it a four of five ranking. Ive already started the next book Flyte and hope it is just or better like this.<br/>**Plot**<br/>The book begins outside of The Castle, in The Ramblings. Here, we find Silas Heap trudging through the snow with some herbal medicines for his wife Sarah Heap. Just outside the castle Silas finds an infant baby girl withviolet eyes, stranded in the snow, and wrapped in a blanket. He hides her in his cloak and takes her with him. Upon returning to a castle, he learns about the succession ofMarcia Overstrand as ExtraOrdinary Wizard. He meets her in an alley way before he gets back and she tells him to keep the baby he found, raise her as his own and if anyone asks, acknowledge her as his daughter. Just as he is out to enter his house, the matron midwife runs out carrying his newborn sonSeptimus Heap (who has been predicted to have extraordinary powers as he is the seventh son of a seventh son) wrapped in cloth and pronouncing him dead. Silas names the baby girl Jenna and raises the child and protects her like his own child.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the events of the time ten years after this incident, starting when Marcia comes to take Jenna in her to protection to stop her from being assassinated. At which point, Marcia also reveals Jenna as the previous Queen's daughter. Marcia takes Jenna away to protect her from an Assassin. Marcia saves Boy 412, a mysterious boy in the Young Army, outside the Wizard Tower from freezing to death, and takes him with them to her room in the tower.Silas, Nicko, and Maxie then come to visit Jenna in the tower. But before they are there for an hour, the Assassin arrives to kill Jenna. Marcia defends Jenna, and they all escape the tower through the rubbish chute. The chute leads them to a dump next to the docks where Nicko helps the group sail away on the Muriel, which is given to them by Sally, Sarah Heap's friend. Secretly in return, Marcia lends Sally her KeepSafe. The Hunter, a henchmen of the Supreme Custodian, is sent to chase them. Marcia uses a Reverse Spell to Projectthe Muriel, the boat that they're sailing on, and distract the Hunter, upon which he loses the groups trail, and has to return to the castle. Nicko, aided by Silas, sails the group to the island where Aunt Zelda lives; a cottage in the Marram Marshes.<br/><br/>On the island, Boy 412 wanders around the marshes, falls into a pit with a large cavern in it, and finds a ring that glows when he places it on his finger. He keeps the ring a secret for sometime though. Marcia then walks with Boy 412, and shows him a charm that Alther, the old ExtraOrdinary Wizard gave to her when she was his Apprentice. Marcia sees that Boy 412 has potential, and asks him to become her Apprentice, but he refuses. Aunt Zelda also helps Jenna, Nicko, and Boy 412 make shield bugs to protect themselves. Marcia then tries to use her Midnight Minutes to protect herself when she goes back to the Wizard Tower because of a letter that said that she should go back. But then she gets captured by the Custodian Guards because she got her Midnight Minutes wrong. A few more weeks pass until the Hunter discover the groups location with Aunt Zelda, in the marshes, and returns to assassinate Jenna. Jenna and Boy 412 defend themselves by using shield bugs, and Aunt Zelda uses a Freezing Spell on the Hunter. Soon after the Hunter was frozen, they try to figure out the identity of DomDaniel's Apprentice, who claims to be Septimus when they capture him. Nicko firmly denies it after seeing what treachery the apprentice could do. Then, the Apprentice escapes and tells DomDaniel of their location.<br/><br/>A bit after that, Aunt Zelda tells Boy 412 that the ring is the legendary Hotep-Ra's dragon ring which gives him control over the Dragon Boat. Aunt Zelda gives Boy 412 a book with the legend of Hotep-Ra. The legend says that Hotep-ra, the first ExtraOrdinary Wizard, was being pursued by people planning to kill him. Therefore, the dragon became a boat to save her mastser and before Hotep-Ra died he put the boat in his hidden temple. Afterward, Boy 412 soon begins to become interested in the art of Magyk, and the mysteries surrounding the ring. Aunt Zelda later tells Boy 412 that the cave in which he found the ring is connected to a secret cavern containing Hotep-ra's temple, and within it, the Dragon Boat. The boat was used by Boy 412, Nicko and Jenna in order to save Marcia and stop DomDaniel from being the ExtraOrdinary Wizard again. The boat talks to Jenna inside her head because she is the Princess. Only Boy 412 can fly and steer the boat. They rescue Marcia, and Boy 412 agrees to become Marcia's Apprentice.<br/><br/>Later, they discover during the apprentice banquet that Boy 412 is really Septimus Heap, the presumed dead son of Silas Heap.<br/>",,,1,0

An unforgettable and an unparalleled reading experience. In all of my reading life (4 years or so...) I truly haven't enjoyed anything this much. The finale to this dark epic fantasy is too much man! It's way too much and all of it is done gloriously. Hats off and a never ending applause to Mister Kristoff for serving a deserving end to the series. Even though it had the biggest page length of the series-560+ pages I managed to finish it off in just three days thanks to it's accessiblility, it's flaming prose and perfect storytelling. Kristoff knows the voice of the reason and approaches the writing with sheer brillance. I have highlighted almost 30% of the book, passages and dialogues included to read and savour the memory of Mia Fucking Corvere's adventure as she battles the darkness within her, seeks revenge for her familia, rids the republic of a truly corrupt Senator and seeks Justice for her loved ones. A grande, epic, no holds barred, a finale worth reading and every word to be savored. I sighed and cried multiple times especially as the darkness and the grim rose to a peak. The book has a discernable structure. The first part lays out the goals for Mia and the secondary characters and also serves as a part where all the characters meet and plan both the antagonists as well as the protagonists play it out very well and the most passionate of the readers will understand, vaguely, where the story might head next. The first part of the book also includes a lot of travels and tales. A lot of mind-blowing secrets are unveiled mostly by Mercurio and the divine librarian as the story unfolds. I was shocked, my gut-punched and my mind grew dizzy as the surprised and shocks came one after the other adding a lot more to the storyline than I'd anticipated helping it grow in its complexity. The second part of the book included fighting off and finishing the Red Church with all of its members and the tone shifted a lot. Most it focused on the secondary characters such as Drusilla, The Magik Wielders, Sid and mostly Ash and Tric and we got a lot of sea voyages and ships and pirates and fearsome and crippling sea monsters like the Kraken and Leviathan. This part also delivered the most location and one to one fights as well as a multitude of sad goodbyes. A lot of blood spilled here. I have a lot to say about Jonnen/Lucius. That boy is a wonder. A true masterpiece of character development that in a single book goes from a stubborn spoilt royal brat to a shadow donning, conscience-driven, and a worthy prodigy that carries Mia's legacy towards the end. A have to bring your attention to a chapter at an inn where all the band of characters sit together and narrate the tales of their sexual misadventures. This is not something I'd expected, especially in the climatic build that the book never stops, never halts, never allows the readers to breathe but plows on and on, the climax only heightening and growing stronger in each passing page but that chapter allowed me to breathe and also served as a reminder of the amazing and relatable, masterfully crafted character work and the raw brilliance and talent that Mostrt Kristoff has. He built an entire fantasy world fueled with tales of Gods like Aa, Niah and The Crown of the Moon intertwining it with perfect antagonists and passions of an eighteen year old girl fighting against everything that challenges her motive...<br/>I never really had such a completely mind blowing and tear jerking but passionately narrated reading experience. I never loved the cast of characters so much. And don't ven get me started about the Wit and the wisdom of the dialogues. Even the swearing and the tomfoolery of it all is sheer brillance and genius. The footnotes are such entertainers that if I steal them and make a stand-up I'll be rich enough to buy one of the seven wonders of the world. Anyways, the third part is where it all goes down. I meant I wouldn't be surprised if the background of the pages was dark and the text was in white print. Never have I ever seen such raw power, Mia unleashes every last bit of her power. When the crown of the moon is in her clutches nothing stands. Even Adonia has to be appreciated with his phantasmagorial art or bloodshed in the Kings Palace in Godsgrave. The entire tale of Aa and Niah is in a full sweep reflecting the real world. All the shadows, the darkness, the gore and blood is on the page. Mr. Kristoff does not hold off. He unleashes his magnificence on the page unrelenting and never releasing the readers from the jaws of the finale. The final 100 pages has me out of breath and drowning in my own sweat with my throat dry and eyes wide open. Perhaps the greatest and the most entertaining fantasy trilogy I've read till date. I've marked enough passages throughout this Trilogy to quote repeatedly about Mia's passionate swearings , Mercurio's wise anecdotes and the wisdom that is to be bestwoed upon a rich three dimensional cast of characters. I had the greatest time even. Thanks a lot Mister Kristoff. I owe you a lot. My GOD, I am shaking right now. Magnificent and Powerful. A truly unparalleled reading experience. Try the audiobooks too.

This is one hell of a tenebrous book. It builds upon its predecessor extremely well. I have so much to say about tis trilogy. I have been excessively obsessing over this book so much. This is everything that I wanted it to be. It carried the legacy and the skill of the first book so well. Truly, Jay Kristoff is a genius. I noted the structure of the plot in this installment in the glorious series and it resembles with that of the first book; it's almost identical except the plot and the situation of the chracters has changed very much. Every word and every page off this book is brimming with poetic narration, kickass dialouge and a sudden never expected turn of events which cycles into the next big turnover and excitement. Its a fast paced journey where we follow Mia Corvere, the hunter now become the huntress donning innumerable baldes and painting the pages red. The sheer amount of details and all the easter eggs thrown into the book at an almost reptative interaval deserves an applaud and more so with all these brillaint things tied at the end. All the hints, all the words through the dialouges that may eem insignificant as events unfold have a greater importance. It's almost as if Kritoff offers the readers a piece of the puzzle, page by page and until we turn to the last chapter, we are unaware of the shocking events and the news that is to be learnt. But as soon as the final page in turned and a loud sigh when the reader actually realizes what he read and drops his jaw, then and only then are al the pieces of the puzzle unlocked and resemble an artistic genius of Jay Kristoff. This book wraps up the mysteries, the questions and many of the plolines exceptionally well and answers almost all of the readers' burning questions exceptionally. I do not have even a single complaint about this book. It was everything I wanted it to be all, all the surprises, the blood chilling action and assassination, the high tension combat, the dark and gloomy atmosphere, exceptional and fantastic world building couple with character development unlike anything I've seen before! This book is a gem for fantaasy readers as well as grimdark readers. A revenge tale with a very unoriginal core but a very original layering, detail and depth. Don't even get me started about the secondary characters in this. Each and every one of them from Ashlinn, Mercurio, the Donna, Leonidus, Julius, Daemo, Sid, the Executus every single one of them was on par with the quality of the series. And surprisijg enough the depth to each of these characters is out of scope of fantasy, it's on a next level, it's completely off the charts which make sit reason enough for me to love them and root for each of them so much because all of them have thier stories, some are passionate, some desperate, some just fighting for their lives like the most of the other characters in this series. Now, at the beginning the readers may not understand where the plot is shifting or heading towards until the tenth chapter where the past and the present become clearly defined. Jay Kristoff uses every opportunity to surprise the readers with his ingenious. I'm just a small step away from worshipping the Gods of Nevernight. Godsgrave as the title suggests is the prrimary location of the setup. The blood and gore is taken to a next level. The action scenes are John Wick-esque except just with knives and swords. The primary battling arena is the Roman sort with the editorii which I can't help but relate with the Hunger Games manipulators controlling and summoning entire seas and sand krakens and wyrms into the Arean! This is a brilliant idea not only to further the plot, glorify Mia Corvere and just deliver gut punching scenes fueling the urge to read on. The ideas about Darkness and the shadows of Mia were very entertaining theri conversation gave many hints of whats to come, Eclipse and Mister Kindly's conversation feels almost like a prophecy of the future or a refleccction of the past. The Roman Empire type of heirarchial system does much justice to the story that Kristoff wants to narrate. Mia's familia had a much more darker untertone than even I suspected. As I reader, If felt that there was a gut wrecking surprise and a tragedy coming as supersonic speed during the final finve chapters of the book. The scene which plays out in the end is only has it's moments played out beacuse of the enromous and the hihgly skilled buildup that is offered with each turn. Mia questions herself and fuels her passions only to learn her deepest and the most feared secrets. That moment of vainglory, that almost perfect assassination of Duomo and the resurfacing of Scaeva in the final chapter with the entire esemble of the Red Church flanking him couple with Ash fleeing and stumbling upon the shadow entity revealed to be Tric is just an orgasmic experience for the reader. But the future of the series still hangs in balance. The crown of the moon, the shadow of four and Mia's reunion with her younger long lost brother as well as the fate of the Ishtari Empire hangs in balance. There is a much bigger game at play here and honestly, I'm diving headfirst. This is going to be the best readign experience that I've ever had. This trilogy rocks. Also, the DICTA ULTIMA gave me chills! Wow! SANGUI E GLORIA!! Nice Reading!",,,1,0

Take me very seriously when I say that this is easily the best and the most hottest stuff in the fantasy/dark genre right now! Even though this was my first Jay Kristoff Book, this feels like I've been following Mister Kristoff for a decade now. The writing is so right up my alley that if I were to explain how much I loved it, how much it seemed to be crafted exactly and just as precisely as I like it, it would be something very odd. I swear that in my entire reading life I have. never come upon such a book that is 100% to my liking, not one fault, everything was tailored just as I loved it, perfect! Enough of the praise, on with the review. This book is right up there with the Broken Empire Trilogy' by Mark Lawrence. I am very hesitant when it comes to big chunks of pages such as these with 400+ pages. I've looked into the sequels which are of 500+ and 600+ pages each and I couldn't have asked for anything else. When it comes to the Nevernight Trilogy I'll feed off  even a 10000+ paged series. I never had the passion and the fuel or the kick that the reader is supposed to get while reading any other book. Hell, this is just the first and we aren't even halfway through. This is easily my favorite book in my reading opinion. Right from the first chapter, with the nitty gritty, dark-fueled, entrapping, immersive and hooking writing and the parallels that Kristoff draws Iris virtually impossible to not like the prose. Bold and dark words intertwined, almost poetic and haunting narrating a vocabulary rich and effective story which is interesting and full of witty dialogue at every single page-mind you, every single page has a surprise or a dialogue or blood or an inescapable calamity, is really the story I had been seeking and finally I have it. I cherished and drank every drop of this fantasy nectar. The antihero Mia, is unlike any female lead you I have seen and that speaks a lot. Right from her thoughts, to her dialogues to her persona and her drive, the author knows every inch of her character, doesn't back away from taking bold Astros which payoff in the end very dramatically. I was never bored, not for a single moment. The world itself is very fantastical. With three suns, a godbased onarchy, God fearing rulers, the Naia-Godess of Death and an assassin school that trains Mia and her like although subverts the Harry Potter training genre while maintaining it's originality and interesting aspect are just a few faces of the brillance of the book. The audiobooks narration is commendable. There is enough action in the book occasioned with plenty bloodshed, a revenge driven motive which fades to a past timeline with intervals that perfectly suit the mood of the book and build upon the rich narrative of the story, ass-kicking dialogues and intense graphical imagery paired with solid sexual description to make even  the most professional erotica reader sigh and end the chapter out of breath. Every word, every passage and every goddamn dialogue in this book has an importance, some parts of it are subtle although noticeable and have a instantaneous payoff while some parts of the narrative are stretched until the until until the entire picture comes together and this you so hard in the face! I swore so loud while reading the book that I'm afraid that I offended the entire city. Anyways, Mia is a kickass character, a solid persona, someone with a deep three dimensional character with immense growth and development throughout these 400 pages. The fantastical setting of the book and the revenge scenario make it for a perfect vintage era fantasy with it's grim and dark setting with an imperial reign of corrupts and an abominable and despicable back story to make even the hardest of the readers shed a tear. I love how the city has the structure of the human body with the Royal embers occupying the upper parts of the skull while the degenerates and pleasure whites occupy the ribs. Also, the names of Towns and characters are very much suitable to the mood the book is selling. Coming to the Red Church, it's a whole new concept into fantasy. A better set of secondary characters and an assassination school does not exist. Everything fits together tightly, no stretched and unimportant or irrelevant scenes at all. The creepy albino sorcerers with their peculiar and frightening skills, the headmistress of the assassin's with her odd charm, the teachers who do not spare their students and tear off there limbs for even the smallest mistake make up for a very bloody and intense reading experience. This book is wild but it is mostly dominated with the Wit and the art to surprise the audience with it's dark writing paired with the stornglt set of secondary and primary characters. The story is propelled with every page, the risk deepens, the passion and the drive of the antihero Mia is evident at every turn of the page. There is enough humour and enough philosophy to qualify it for being quotable for another century at the least. I've never been so excited to read a book. The fantasy and. unreal facts in the book such as shadow art, the power pyramid, the student rivalry are just icing on the cake. This book is so intelligent and hooking, I cannot stress it enough that it is original and subverts all expectations that e readers are tired of. It takes the book of tropes, turns it upside down, adds another twist to them, combines and tears them, analyses them and put it in the readers face for floating and appreciation paired with an awful catchphrase or a punchline which makes for a jaw dropping quote and this charm is carried out at every single page which makes it my favorite book till date. I'm very excited for the final two books in the trilogy. This has me head deep into the story and the future that awaits for our anti-hero. This has been an unprallelled and a very fresh experience. I'll be quoting and acting out my favorite scenes all the time. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

Mark Lawrence is truly an underrated writer. I wonder why he hasn't blown up to the likes of Branden Sanderson yet. The analysis and the study that underwent the creation of this book is huge. It has powerful primary characters in terms of physical strength as well as story writing goes. Snorri, is my favorite Vikings from the books. Muscular, emphatic and with a solid past and this goes hand in hand with our portagonists Jalan Kendeth. In some ways, I feel I'm half part Jorg and half part Jalan if it makes any sense. The first half of the book is very interesting. Those acquainted with the Broken Empire' can see some small hints about the continuity, the parallels and the atmosphere of the overlooming doom. As this is a first person narration, we never get bored of Jalan, who constantly keeps throwing funny punchlines and philosophical suggestions applicable in life, with a bit of degeneracy and sinful attitude. Jalan is truly be of his kind and I'm sure that fantasy hosts so less of such archetypes. Coming to the story, it's not as dark as Prince of Thrones but leans a bit more towards a humorous side couple with adventuring and frequented by a few supernatural, occult scenes which keep the book light paced and easy to finish in a day or two at most even though it is 500 pages long. The events of the last book shook me, especially the end. The character progression was really well done and we saw Jalan undergo some changes which evolve him as a character and I can't see how radially he has changed for the second book. The journeying and the dangers faced on the road like the Undead, the Unborn and the necromancer's and witches could have been more frequent but I'm very much Happy to see where it all goes from here. Amazing stuff as always. Let's see if the second book gets a 5/5. Nice Reading.",,,1,0

Stay Away!)<br/><br/>So now, moving on, here are the reasons I fell completely in love with the book....<br/>(P.S -  I’m writing this review after rereading the book,  when I read it for the first time, I was barely a teenager, I couldn’t grasp the beauty of writing but I’m glad I picked up this great work of fantasy.<br/>The first thing that I liked about the book is it’s front cover and synopsis. I was delighted to see the young adult prince with a sword and human carcasses surrounding him and the wind blowing, the fancy ‘Prince of Thorns’ written in a fancy script. Mind you, I do judge a book by it’s cover. The synopsis at the back of the book really attracted me to the story, it was truthful and provided the essence of the story that a ‘dark fantasy’ reader direly requires. And I read the digital version of the book on my kindle so it was much easier to take some notes and highlight some philosophical and bad-ass dialogues and scenes worth reading later, not just this, I also downloaded a free copy of the audiobook with it’s rich and apt narration from (Audiobookbay.com) which thoroughly enriched my experience.<br/>I have taken some really interesting quotes and dialogues from the book which you will find below..<br/>Right from the first chapter, I was hooked by the plot and the story, the first person narration of Jorg Ancrath who plays a pivotal and a major part in the story. I could never think of a better headstart and introduction to the memorable ‘Band of Brothers’ on the road. Let me tell you one thing very clearly, IF YOU WANNA ENJOY THE BOOK, IF YOU TRULY WANNA ENJOY THE BOOK TO IT’S BEST, THEN HEED MY WORDS, STAY AWAY FROM ANY KIND OF DISTURBANCES AND DISTRACTIONS, DO NOT SKIP EVEN A WORD, DO NOT LEAVE A CHAPTER UNFINISHED TO READ LATER, READ SLOWLY AND STEADILY TAKING IN ALL THE MAGIC AND THE BEAUTY CRAFTED BY MARK LAWRENCE, IF YOU CANNOT DO THIS, PUT THE BOOK DOWN AND SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE OF GOING THROUGH 370+ PAGES OF GIBBERISH THAT YOU WOULDN’T CLEARLY UNDERSTAND, ALSO SAVE THE 1-STAR RATING ON GOODREADS. PLEASE!<br/>Okay, the story goes on building nice and steady with plot developments at every single corner of the book, the characters interaction with each other is another highlight of the book and as Jorg is the central character, he interacts with everybody else (It’s the way it works..) and that means you get nothing other than the best as a reader. The story has many layers to it, it has many things to teach. The book has adapted a first person narration so the story is told from the point of a single person, namely Jorg, who goes on tnking and thinking, swearing and swearing, killing and killing and a lot of other immoral stuff. The story includes almost everything you could imagine such as castles, empires, knights, young boys, bitches, ghosts, necromancers, wizards, sorcerers, witches, mages, skeletons, counts, civilians and an empire sucked into feuds and fights. It seems that the book is inspired from Game of Thrones but it’s completely original and unique in it’s story. The story has mixed aspects and switches between past and the present timelines, i enjoyed both of them equally. Both the timelines relate to Jorg’s childhood as well as his current situation. I would like to inform you that each chapter ends with a perfect and a hallucinating note, one that leaves you thinking and has an air of surprise surrounding it. In fact, the plot line of the book isn’t predictable at all, you really have pay attention to understand where the story and the characters are headed next. You never really know the ultimate goal and the mission of Jorg. The story is perfectly balanced and narrated in rich words, sometimes describing, sometimes speeding. The characters and the locations throughout the book are just icing on the cake. They may seem a bit haughty and naughty but my my, you won’t realize the magic they are working on you until you read the book yourself. The characters are well versed in their occupations and jobs I would say. Each word that comes out from the mouth of the young prodigy, Jorg is divine to me, that boy, though he may be dark, grim and seeking revenge, is just great! His dialogues are enlightening and taught a lot to me regarding how the world really works. Other than this the mages, the witches, the bitches, the necromancers and all the other gruesome, abominable and obnoxious characters die teaching an immense lesson to the readers, it’s just that you have to grab it by reaching under those hidden layers. The battle scenes are intense, written in such a manner that I was convinced that they are happening in front of me, just like a movie or a play. The description of the beasts, the castles is rich and convincing.... There are many humorous instances in the book almost on every single page that make you laugh out aloud, not the jokes that you’d imagine, not even in your dreams, these jokes are darker and horrifying, you’d laugh nervously. Sometimes, the plot and the characters are savage and nothing stops them from getting what they truly want. I just loved everything about Jorg, his dialogues, his backstory, his appearance, his outlook towards life and his wish to “Win the Game of Thrones.” This is the unique thing seen only in the broken empire series. I enjoyed how the book set up a dark and a grim atmosphere that seemed real to the reader and then pushed the characters into terrifying scenes battling for their life, it just busts pasts your expectations. Some scenes made me smile, Jorg’s personality is so smug and negative, it’s just indescribable. The characters and the locations influence the plot very much. The book takes twists and turns, giving the reader a scary ride. Dark Humour, Fantasy, Battle, Action, Blood and Gore, Vices, immoral acts are some of the highlights of the book. If you like politics and kings, this is a book for you. It inspires you to live your life in a different fashion. The Prince of Thorns has pitiful backstory which has shaped his current character. I would love to see what happens in the following books. The tactics, strategy, weapons are something to look out for. This is probably the first book which I didn’t hurry through in order to finish it, I just knew this isn’t the type of book where you can rush. There is a deeper message in each page and not just a grotesque story with hideous and bloody characters. This is a story of revenge, murder and bloodshed. The book was way beyond my expectations and I enjoyed it the way it was meant to be enjoyed, if you didn’t I pity you. The book goes really fast in the beginning and the end but slows down a bit in the middle. The short notes written by Jorg at the end of each chapter provide a deeper insight to the ‘Band Of Brothers’. Truly, this is a kind of book that you wouldn’t want to miss. So, just grab it and start reading. The locations include caves, castles, palaces, battlefields, throne rooms, the road, arenas and icy mountains. The supernatural twist added in the book is icing on the cake. There is a backstory for all the characters, some you will hate and some you will like. I related very much to Jorg and I was terrified by the young boy, the young prince who has an edge over everybody else. The author writes really well, so well that you can’t wonder how he does it, the magical writing is enchanting and so convincing, I’m brimming with imagination. The world building is just basic right now but will enrich in the following books. Mark Lawrence has laid the base of the ‘Broken Empire’ trilogy very well, he is thorough and knows where the plot and the characters are heading. True, that he has a nasty way of killing of his  creations but in the end, the writing style cannot fail to impress you, the dark humour, the irony and the unending figures of speech. Fantasy writing at it’s best. I’m really looking forward to read the next book as soon as possible, as slow as possible. Nice Reading,<br/><br/>Below are the quotes that I found really interesting and memorable:-<br/><br/>*The town-square ran red. Blood in the gutters, blood on the flagstones, blood in the fountain. The corpses posed as corpses do. Some comical, reaching for the sky with missing fingers, some peaceful, coiled about their wounds. Flies rose above the wounded as they struggled. This way and that, some blind, some sly, all betrayed by their buzzing entourage.<br/><br/>*That red face just made me want to kill him even more. I didn’t, though. You got responsibilities when you’re a leader. You got a responsibility not to kill too many of your men. Or who’re you going to lead?<br/><br/>*The thorns taught me the game. They let me understand what all those grim and serious men who’ve fought the Hundred War have yet to learn. You can only win the game when you understand that it is a game. Let a man play chess, and tell him that every pawn is his friend. Let him think both bishops holy. Let him remember happy days in the shadows of his castles. Let him love his queen. Watch him lose them all. <br/><br/>*It is purity of spirit that will keep corruption from the flesh.<br/><br/>*Hate will keep you alive where love fails.<br/><br/>*“Tell me, tutor,” I said. “Is revenge a science, or an art?”<br/><br/>*Now I thought of Father, and it felt good to know I could still feel fear.<br/><br/>*<br/>War is a thing of beauty, as I’ve said before, and those who say otherwise are losing.<br/><br/>*A hundred fragments of empire grinding away at each other in a never-ending cycle of little wars, feuds, skirmishes, kingdoms waxing, waning, waxing again, lifetimes spent in conflict and nothing changing. Mine to change, to end, to win.<br/><br/>*“Think about it, Makin. I made Roddat here fight like a madman because I told him if they think you’re not going to give up, they’ll break. Now I’ve got fifty enemies who’re out there telling everyone who’ll listen, ‘That Prince of Ancrath, he’s not going to break.’ It’s a simple sum. If they think we won’t break, they give up.” All true. It wasn’t the reason, but it was all true.<br/><br/>*“Boys of ten are better occupied with Euclid and Plato. When we visit war, Sun Tzu will be our guide. Strategy and tactics, these are of the mind, these are the tools of prince and king.”<br/><br/>*“We are defined by our enemies. This holds true for men, and by extension, their countries,”<br/><br/>*Cowards make the best torturers. Cowards understand fear and they can use it. Heroes on the other hand, they make terrible torturers. They don’t see what motivates a normal man. They misunderstand everything. They can’t think of anything worse than besmirching your honour. A coward on the other hand; he’ll tie you to a chair and light a slow fire under you. I’m not a hero or a coward, but I work with what I’ve got.”<br/><br/>*“The way to break the cycle is to kill every single one of the bastards that fucked you over,” I said. “Every last one of them. Kill them all. Kill their mothers, kill their brothers, kill their children, kill their dog.”<br/><br/>*One nail will bring back memories of childhood. Another will make him rage, or sob, or laugh. In the end it seems we’re just toys, easy to break and hard to mend.<br/><br/>*“Terror and entertainment are weapons of statehood, Jorg.” Lundist kept his tone neutral, his face inscrutable save for a tightness in the lips suggesting that the words carried a bad taste. “Execution combines both elements.”<br/><br/>*When we make a mistake, we can’t buy our way out of it. Not with horses, not with gold.<br/><br/>*“It’s not a game, Sir Makin. You teach these boys to play by the rules, and they’re going to lose. It’s not a game.”<br/><br/>*Anything that you cannot sacrifice pins you. Makes you predictable, makes you weak.<br/><br/>*“I’ll see if I can dream a witch tonight, yours or mine, I don’t care. And if I do, this time I’m not running anywhere. I’m going to turn around and gut the bitch.”<br/><br/>*Wait when waiting is called for. That’s what Lundist used to tell me. But never hesitate.<br/><br/>*“There are turning points, Robart. Forks in the path we follow through our lives. Times that we look back to and say, ‘If only.’ This is one of those times. It’s not often we get them pointed out to us. At this point you’ll either decide to hate me, or to serve me. Consider the choice carefully.” <br/><br/>*“The thorns . . . the thorns held me, Mother.”<br/><br/>*She looked at me, eyes silver with the moon. She smiled and I thought for a moment she would forgive me. Then she screamed. She didn’t scream the screams she’d made when the Count’s men raped her. I could have stood that. Maybe. She screamed the screams she made when they killed William. Ugly, hoarse, animal screams, torn from her perfect painted face.<br/><br/>*You need to understand what game is being played out here. Who exactly the pieces are and who the players are.<br/><br/>*When in doubt, let your hate lead you. Normally I’d reject that advice. It makes a man predictable. But there, in that miserable hall of bones, I was past caring. Hate was all I had to keep me warm. <br/><br/>*The necromancer had lifted the veil. Just like the Nuban said, she had lifted the veil between the worlds and the dead were coming through.<br/><br/>*I took a bite, as big as I could manage. Raw flesh is chewy, but the necromancer’s heart had some give in it, like a game bird hung until it’s ready to drop off the hook. The bitter gall of the blood scoured my throat. I swallowed my mouthful and it slid down, slow and sour.<br/><br/>*They say fear lends a man wings. None of the brothers flew up the Stair, but the way they scrambled over the slickness of that rocky throat would teach a lizard plenty about climbing.<br/><br/>*“Memories are dangerous things. You turn them over and over, until you know every touch and corner, but still you’ll find an edge to cut.<br/><br/>*“Each day the memories weigh a little heavier. Each day they drag you down that bit further. You wind them around you, a single thread at a time, and you weave your own shroud, you build a cocoon, and in it madness grows.”<br/><br/>*“Jorg, you said ‘enough to poison the world,’” Makin said. “The world is already poisoned, Sir Makin,” I said.<br/><br/>*“One life, or ten thousand, I can’t see the difference. It’s a currency I don’t understand.”<br/><br/>*I wondered how many of Father’s soldiers would have died here if he had sent his armies to avenge my mother. Perhaps it was better this way. Better that I come calling. More personal. She was my mother after all. Father’s soldiers had their own mothers to be worrying about.<br/><br/>*“It has to be one of the Hundred. Nations won’t follow monsters like me. They’ll follow a lineage, divine right, the spawn of kings. So we who have taken our power from the places where others fear to reach . . . we play the game of thrones with pieces like Count Renar, pieces like your father. Pieces like you, perhaps.”<br/><br/>*“Whatever my father is, he isn’t inept,” I said. “I should have died.”<br/><br/>*“I may be running out of options, but running out isn’t an option. Not for me.”<br/><br/>*I threw everything I had against him. All my pride, my anger, an ocean of it, the rage, the hurt. I reached back across the years. I counted my dead. I reached into the briar and touched the bloodless child who hung there. I took it all, and made a hammer of it.<br/><br/>*The wild hoof hit me square in the back. I would probably have flown ten yards if I hadn’t crashed straight into Corion. As it was, we flew about five yards together.<br/><br/>*I think maybe we die every day. Maybe we’re born new each dawn, a little changed, a little further on our own road. When enough days stand between you and the person you were, you’re strangers. Maybe that’s what growing up is. Maybe I have grown up.<br/><br/>*If you lose you have lost. And What have you lost? You have lost the Game!",,,1,0

When he was fifteen, he began to fulfill that vow. Now he is eighteen—and he must hold on by strength of arms to what he took by torture and treachery.<br/>King Jorg is a man haunted: by the ghost of a young boy, by a mysterious copper box, by his desire for the woman who rides with his enemy. Plagued by nightmares of the atrocities he committed, and of the atrocities committed against him when he was a child, he is filled with rage. And even as his need for revenge continues to consume him, twenty thousand men march toward the gates of his castle. His enemy is far stronger than him. Jorg knows that he cannot win a fair fight.<br/>But he has found, in a chamber hidden beneath the castle, ancient and long-lost artifacts. Some might call them magic. Jorg is not certain—all he knows is that the secrets they hold can be put to terrible use in the coming battle… <br/><br/>This is such a great addition to the broken empire trilogy, it truly deserves to be the sequel of the much loved Prince of Thorns. I was astonished I could finish this chunk of 575 pages just within a period of four days, but readers be warned, this book as much addicting as it is exciting. The Broken Empire series truly deserves an applaud because the author seems to have done a meticulous amount of research in order to write the book in a much better fashion. Okay, so let’s head down to a systematic review.<br/> The narration style of the book changes draastically, of course, the cetnral figure is Jorg Ancrath, our young anti-hero, now 18 years old in the present timeline and 15 year old in the past timeline. The past timeline takes place ‘4 years earlier’, just the aftermath of the Prince of Thorns and how it shaped Jorgs personality. The present timeline is regarded as the ‘Wedding Day’, but don’t expect the wedding to be your usual grand ceremony. This ‘Wedding Day’ takes a roundabout 200 pages of the book, the story is narrated just about the single day. But, here’s a surprise, there’s another additional narrative relating to Katherine Ap Scarron, Jorg’s (So called) aunt, just about his age. This narrative is in form of entries collected from Katherine’s persoanl diary, mostly covers up about 60 pages from the book. So, in conclusion the book has three seperate narratives. Mind you, I just lve the way how the story entwines within these narratives but if you read inconsistently, then you’ll find yourself all jumbled up and ‘Oh My God…’ is something you would say if you haven’t read Prince of Thorns, the first book in the broken Empire series. So read carefully, read consistently, read steadily and try to understand what’s happening in the book, mostly stay away from distractions because Mr. Mark Lawrence writes in such a way that demands your full conciousness while reading. Enough with the jigle mingle, let’s just get into the story. Be ready to see some recurring characters as well as some new characters, both of which will surely entice you. The characters in the present timeline and the characters in the past timeline are varied, many die, some survive. (When You Play The game Of Thrones You Win Or You Die, There’s No Middle Ground-Cersei Lannister) So, let me first get into the most important relic/item that’s seen in the book, ‘The Memory Box’, a magical box that can store your memories within them resulting that you forget them until you want to retrieve them from the box, the ‘Memory Box’ is currently owned by Jorg and many of his memories, in fact, pieces of his scattered memories have been stored up inside the box. This, is undoubetedly the most important part in the book as it reveals some drastically noteworthy events that happened during Jorg’s young life. Some other important characters in the present as well as the past timeline are Olidan, Jorg’s bloody father; Katherine, Jorg’s aunt and love interest; Makin, Jorg’s bodyguard and close friend; Prince of Arrow and his brother who wish to take the Empire Throne by overtaking Jorg and attacking the Renar Highlands under his domain; Gog and Gorgoth, the last of the ‘Magical beings’ race forged by the builder’s magic, both of these play a very important part in the present and the past timeline and finally the Road Brothers. <br/>  First, let’s get into the past timeline, the character development was rapid with Jorg but extremely slow with other characters but nonetheless interesting. Jorg seems a very different person now, he has his own opinion on things and doesn’t love killing, maiming and torturing as much as he did in the past, being a king has certainly changed him or so it seems. He goes on various quests, mist of which felt rather unimportant but still I was amazed how much they influenced and connected to the present timeline. Not only this, but the past timeline seems very much like the predecessor book, maybe becasue it involves journeys into the dark lands, quests, politic, sorcery and necromancy mostly. I think the past timeline is indeed a significant connecting link. We see a lot of action, plot development and annoying dialouges exchanged between the characters. But I have only one complaint, the author has tried to build a vast expanse of the world, unnecessary descriptions, unncessary characters resulting in unnecessary interactions and battles which only favour the plot, story, world and character development which is not essentail, or at least that’s what I think, the author may be comfortable with this but it makes it really hard for the readers to focus on the central story. There are just way too many secondary/tertiary characters I encountered throughout the book, its no less than a high fantasy, too hard to remember their names but they do have a unique and appeasing personality that makes you want to continue reading. The locations spread out in the past timeline in the book are just amazing, I have no other words- desserts, evergreen forests, tundras, icy mountians, fiery volcanoes, castles, circuses, dark chambers, necromancer chambers and battlefields, I mean could it get any better! The world in the Broken Empire obviously is a dark place but the author has takes away some ‘Darkness’ from the world and replaced it with just a wee bit of less appaling humour. Jorg’s new perspective to the world has changed completely how the readers percieve the narration style, it’s more grim and gothic… As I said previously, the story is a bit slow but it just enriches the reading expereince if you understand what I mean to say. I hated the ‘Grandfather of Jorg’ chapters thoroughly, hated them to my core and that’s why the book is losing a star. Jorg steadily acquires some new traits due to his new experiences which help him cope with life and understand it’s importance, this fact is highlighted throughout the book, it significantly influences the descisions taken by Jorg in the future timeline. The most important thing in the past timeline is the necromancers and sorceres who control the rulers and people in powers. Fitzwald, Chella, Sageous, Codin are some very important necromancers/mages seen in this timeline, Jorg battles them all! It should be noted that all these necromancers/mages highlight the ascendance of the ‘Dead King’ and hint Jorg to join them agianst the world, so it’s very clear that the Dead King is the antagonist of the next book.<br/>  Now, Katherine’s journal is as interesting as the other two narrative, if not more, the girl is really torn apart by her horrible experiences and trials and tribulations that she has gone through, that is clearly depicted in her journals. Her stories fill in the gaps and the pacifies the unanswerd questions left in the previous book. Her own narration is mature but saddening, it seems that she purely hates Jorg, loses control of her life, is dominated by other but in the end she truly grabs the torch of female uprising, her motive is clear and she picks up some high ambitions. Her narration informs the readers about how she’s tricked and played as a puppet througout the book. As the narration is very short, it complements the elastic nature of plot development from the main narrative and provides a bit of relief to the readers. <br/> The present narrative takes place on the ‘Wedding Day’ of Jorg Ancrath as he marries a twelve year old, Miana, a sharp, clever and a strategic girl who seems too young for her age and intelligence. Some readers may find the present timeline a bit mundane as it’s all about a castle siege and battlefield wars. But, there’s a deeper meaning in it if you find it. Most of the present timeline covers up on how the past timeline affected the wars of the present. How Jorg went out and seeked a variety of alliances and powerful equipments which resulted in his final victory over the princes of Arrow. The battles, the strategy and the plans of Jorg and Miana in order to win the unescapable and seemingly impossible battles against Arrow (with a thousand soldiers against twenty thousand) are very practical and attractive. This timeline has a different air around it. The author has depicted Jorg in a brilliant fashion and his overall thinking process is much influenced by his past experiences, a very different person now but with the same ambitions he had years ago and the essence of revenge too. Also, even though it’s called hte present timeline, Jorg opens the memory box around ten to twelve times and retrieves his memory, so we get some more glimpses of the past which are the *most* interesting theme in the book. They are short, sweet, very important and interesting. The book gives a variety of messages to the reader that all odds can be overcome with determination and sheer will. Jorg is indeed a character that I won’t forget till eternity. The ending and the conclusion was the sweet fruit of the effort of going through all those pages. The final pages of the book will shake you and inspire you to pick the next book as soon as you finish the last word. A powerful book which has changed the way I think about life. Perfectly balanced, wonderfully written, strongly recommended. Here are some quotes and highlights from the book which I enjoyed very much:-<br/>*“Terms?” I said it again. I’d only said it twice but already the word sounded strange, losing meaning as they do when repeated over and again.<br/>*“A volcano,” I said. “Four volcanoes actually. And a fire-mage. Or so my tutor told me. So let’s put the benefits of a royal education to the test, shall we? At least Gog will like it there. Everything burns.”<br/>*Sometimes I wonder if we all don’t have a blue-steel spring inside us, like that dena of Gorgoth’s coiled tight at the core. I wonder if we don’t all go stamping and crashing, crashing and stamping in our own little circles going nowhere. And I wonder who it is that laughs at us.<br/>*In any case I would cut myself a path to the throne even if some bastard-born herder had fathered me on a gutter-whore—genealogy can work for me or I can cut down the family tree and make a battering ram. Either way is good.<br/>*Some pain you can distance yourself from, but a headache sits right where you live.<br/>*Memory is all we are. Moments and feelings, captured in amber, strung on filaments of reason. Take a man’s memories and you take all of him. Chip away a memory at a time and you destroy him as surely as if you hammered nail after nail through his skull. I would have back what was mine. I would open the box.<br/>* I shook the snow-globe again, and once more the all-encompassing blizzard rose, chaos, followed by calm, by settling snows, and a return to the world before. I shook it again. It seemed wrong. All that storm and fury signifying nothing. The whole world upheaved, and for what? The same man trudged toward the same church, the same woman waited at the same cottage door. I held a world in my hand, and however I shook it, however the pieces fell, in whatever new patterns, nothing changed. The man would never reach the church.<br/>*They say that time is a great teacher but unfortunately it kills all its pupils. The mountains are also great teachers, and better still, they let the occasional star pupil live.<br/>*Climb a mountain, see the world from its highest point, and a new man will climb down to a world of subtle differences the next day.<br/>*I have my own fires banked and burning, and on some days the right spark can set them blazing beyond my control.<br/>*You can cut seven shades from a man. Scarlet arterial blood, purple from the veins, bile like fresh-cut grass, browns from the gut, but it all dries to somewhere between rust and tar.<br/>*I’m not him because we die a little every day and by degrees we’re reborn into different men.<br/>*“Old men make old words holy. I say old words are worn out and should be set aside. Take a new bride to bed, not a hag,” I said, thinking of Ekatri. “A fool may scrawl on a slate and if no one has the wit to wipe it clean for a thousand years, the scrawl becomes the wisdom of ages.”<br/>*“These things seem terribly important when you’re young. Matters of the heart and groin. They fill your world at eighteen. But believe me. When you’re the wrong side of forty-five and the past is a bright haze…they’re more important still. Do something. You’re haunted by many ghosts. I know that, though you hide it well.”<br/>*Paying for goods still feels odd to me, but it’s a good habit to get into when you’ve the coin to spare. Of course you should steal every now and then, take something by force just for the wickedness of it, or how else will you keep your hand in the game? But aside from that, paying is recommended, especially if you’re a king with a pocketful of gold.<br/>*I had left my monsters in the North—Gog and Gorgoth—my demons I carried south with me as ever.<br/>*Once upon a time perhaps I might have thought two women running around on fire was a free show. Rike would laugh that laugh of his even now. Row would bet on which one would fall first. But of late my old tastes had gone sour. I had grown to understand this kind of pain. And whatever enchantments might have staged this show for me, these people had felt real. They had felt kind. A truth ran through this lie and I didn’t like it.<br/>*She used Katherine’s words from the graveyard. Maybe what is spoken in such places is always heard by those who have married Death.<br/>*“I’ve lived the last ten years on hunches, bets, hope, and luck.”<br/>*We ride for Arrow. I feel they owe me a castle at the very least. A palace might be nice too. And all those dead soothsayers and seers of the future—we’re friends now.

The very first noticeable thing I found about this book is how much parallel it is with the Broken Empire Series written by Mark Lawrence. The tropes, character nature and the general dark and grim theme that the author wishes to imply is almost similar to that of Jorge Ancrath and his 'Road Brothers' but this series is much more popular and known to the wider udience. It is somewhat pale and just a hint lighter than the Broken Empire but the protagonists/anti-heroes are powered by the same drives, revenge and redemption and this book does pretty good by Leigh Bardugo's standard. Obviously, not the best novel I've read this year but certainly in the top 10 list of 2019 reads. I never would have thought that Bardugo would have the expertise to conjure a fascinating, interesting and over the top violent cast of characters that we follow and get obsessed in this book. Maz, as it should go without saying is a kick-ass to say the least. His ruthlessness, rationale, pragmatic Outlook and tactfulness is noticeable at every turn of the page, or at least in the chapters he appears. This will be an unforgettable character for me. The writing is absolutely genius and the depth that goes into the novel is of course is remarkable. The representation and the diversity of the characters should also be noted. The author builds upon her richly crafted Grisha Verse and delivers an enchanting story beyond the scope of imagination with much spice, grit and the overall grimdark tone which I very much appreciate and love. Other characters are also not too far behind with Inej, the young assassin, scaler, scout having a really terrifying background. She fits in the plot a bit too well with her crafty skills and strong Spirited soul. She adds a lot of fun and excitement to the storyline thanks to her emotional appeal. Trust me, she is not a happy cheater just an empowered one. Her journey through the book and her feelings for Maz make this book a lot better. I simply loved her POV chapters. Next up, Nina, the Heartrender is also bewitching and this character takes the story where I never could have possibly imagined it to go but also stretching it in a few places which doesn't add much to the story. Nina is a character who I always facing a dilemma and it's indulges the reader to see how the consequences of her decisions play out, especially at the climax. Jesper, Malias and some other secondary characters were honestly my least favorite from the book. But even theses characters and a lot to add to the story and that is very much appreciated. Their contribution to the story and their influence to primary characters is of great importance and it is undeniable that they are a necessary part of the storyline and rest assured that they are certainly tolerable. Coming towards the narration, it's clever, the author knows where the story is heading and craftfully guides it in that direction, a bit slowly and steadily at times but it does hit it's Mark, powerfully and with great impact and delivers great content to the reader. I'm very satisfied with the end and the beginning and can't stop feeling sorry for Maz despite his ambition, rage and mastery. The book feels a bit stretched, especially through pages 200-350 where the prison break actually happens and that was not my favorite part and I'll confess that I kept reading only.  beacuse the dilaouges and character interaction was good and the way the execution of the prison break was done was not at all upto standards. Of course, the details and description of the Ice Court and the intricate security system there were appealing to me but something major lacked there. It didn't feel like the oh-so-anticipated jailbreak and it was much of a 'meh' experience for me. The book has a lot of twists and turns to keep the reader going and the climax just hits the mark and will certainly please most readers. The story is full of deception, flashbacks, adventure, crippled characters, drug abuse, supernatural elements, heists, emarkable palaces, an indulgent cast of characters, surprises, actions and witty dialogues. Nice Reading. Hopping on to the next immediately.",,,1,0

Terry Pratchett is a genius. A lot of metaphors and figures of speech adds so much more depth to the story and added to my enjoyment. I blazed through this book in two days! Major character additions like that of Cohen (The Barabrian), the librarian, the Wizards Guild as well as the recurring character of Rincewind and Twolflower (Who I'll miss a lot!) make this book a Worthy sucessor to it's predecessor. The writing is not complex but driven with subtle and we'll placed humour. The story is very eventful, with a lot of action, travelling around, murdering (light-heartedly), witty and laugh out loud discussions among lead characters and a whole lot of cheating Death and the End of the World. The storyline is more centric and I find the lack of chapter system amazing as it suits the story and keeps the humour alive. There's a lot of point of view changes in this book which helps the reader to focus on some other antagonistic and inherently funny characters, this being Discworld. A lot of parody, word puns and situational mess is seen at frequent intervals which makes it a whole lot more entertaining. I think that this book established a whole lot of secodnary characters which I know will be recurring in the following Rincewind books. The world building is heavy on the whole but appears to be bite sized, no way am I going to be remembering the names of all the wacky characters and richly but intentionally comedically described locations and hence I prefer to use the Discworld Fictionary. I would not have imagined Rincewind saving the world by the end of the book but the hints were dropped and any reader could see that happening a mile away. The Luggage has also take a central role in the story and is wild and a total menace. Twoflower is the most adorable character. Absolutely loved it. Hopping on the next one.",,,1,0

The world building is heavy and it has all the elements that is love to see in a fantasy parody book. First of allx this does justice to the Rincewind cycle by involving heavy terminology like mages, wizards and sorcerers with a clearly defined and very much humorous setting of the right son of the eight son (and of an eight son, this a squared wizard). The continuity of the Rincewind cycle is respected and we see a few recurring characters but most of the elements of the story even location wise have been seen before but are heavily built upon. Conina and Nijel make a very good pair. Perhaps, Conina is the most mature and pragmatic characters as well as a hot dame! Never expected her to be the daughter of Cohan the Barbarian. Even Nijel is a to-be-barbarian but is quite funny and whimsical. Rincewind if course, has now a more fleshed out personality and no more am amateur to the wizard business and encounters most of the dilemma's with ease. I wish we could see a bit more of Coin, the young sourcerer but that was the only gripe I had with the story. The novel is frequented with the Discworld made famous word puns, parodies, nonsensical but witty and we'll placed jokes and remarks, the comedic exchange of words and laugh out loud dialogues and all the aspects and bits & pieces of a dark comedy.

I don't think this book is accessible to younger people (13 and under) mostly because of its complex yet very entertaining narration, fast-paced but striking and intelligible humour and well as a few explicit scenarios and subtle fantasy world building with a heavy payoff. Terry Prachett is a genius! This is a remarkable book with a lot of goofs, Easter eggs, pop culture references and allusions to some of my favorite folklore and fantasy as well as subtle, peculiar and well-plaxed humour. This was an adventure for me. A thorough reading experience with utterly captivating and invigorating although sometimes mentally challenging narration that developed me as a reader.

I'm a sucker for the exceptional alliterations, metaphors and inventive and laugh out loud collocations that are so we'll placed and hit hard.

I knew the basic characters like Arthur, Merlin (here Merlyn), Sir Kay, Sir Ector, Lancelot, etc. Many people recommended this book 'The Sword in the Stone' which is the part 1 of the OATFK therefore I took it into consideration and started reading. It was far better and at the same time far worse from my expectations. The book is the classical retelling of the original Arthurian Legends. I thought it would be a serious and a direct story but it had humour, witty dialogues and funny events in it aimed at younger kids but with the language that they wouldn't easily understand, especially the dialogues of personalities like king Pellinore and Merlyns witty philosophy. The book sometimes was truly great with small adventures like Tom Sawyer and sometimes extremely boring (All the parts where Wart ""King Arthur"" is turned into birds and animals by Merlyn) are the most boring. There is no aim and usefulness of this. Apart from this the book is pretty good. The dialogues and the witty humour is the most adorable. I would like to warn anyone who is taking up these books not to keep any expectations or judge it by its covers, I guarantee you that its totally different from what you'd think. White has created controversial characters. Merlyns personality is a lot like Gandalf!(Not Dumbledore). Ectors is like Hatake Kakashi, cool and calm but decisive. Kay is good for nothing bray with a bright future and Wart Aka Arthur is a simple young boy in search for adventures and answers about this world. The book sometimes progresses really slow and sometimes really fast. The worst parts at those when Arthur gets converted into insects and birds by Merlyn as a part of ""Educational Aid."" Robin Hood is also mentioned here. It focuses in the young age and how he came I be the king. I like the parts when Arthur meets Merlyn, the boar hunt, the Christmas celebration and the teaching classes and I totally hate the transformation parts. They should be erased from the book.  I personally think that the last few chapters were a bit rushed. I learned 165 new words from the book. I think children above 13 can read this book as it has some descriptive nature, mind blowing dialogs, boring lectures and lots of fun! Watch out. This is not the usual King Arthur you want.  It is a fairly average book and takes around 2 days to read if you really are interested.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The second book in the series and a truly different one from its first. The writing style is somewhat same but the story is different. We see Arthur suddenly grown up and mature. There are a lot of new characters in the book particulatly the Orkney clan and Morguase. White sets up unique characters and how they will affect the future of Arthur. There are obviously like the previous book trival chats and hunts. I would say that White focuses a lot on minor things and takes the major things very fast and speeds them up. E.g the questing beast arc takes up around 100pgs and the battle against King lot and Arthur's parentage as well as the incest of Arthur x Morguase which was interesting was just described in 3 lines. This is the most negative featured of the book. The questing beast and the four children of Morgues has been given lot of importance. Maybe they'll play a good role in the future. Also Pellinore and Grummore play a major part. Morgues has been given the title of Queen aptly cause she is dominating and also that he's arthurs sister. Merlins strategies and his future prophecies are important as he reveals Arthur's parents as well as the fact that Morgue was his sisters later regretting the birth  Mordred. The book is shifting and descriptive . there's also a lot if honor that will make you laugh but not much story which may make t boring for younger reader who are not acquainted with this type of classical works.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It's interesting to see how each book / volume from the once and the future king series progresses and grows more mature, brining in delicate and sensitive issues. Even the language and the tone of writing is different. In  the Ill made knight the central story focused on the revered and legendary Sir Lancelot, the best knight of Arthur and his services and secrets and associations with Guinevere, Arthur's wife. The story is not at all humorous and it does not follow a straight plotline. There are 2 time leaps in the book. A 2 year leap and a major 15 year leaf. So the book covers around 19-20 years of Lancelot's life. The story begins with a nice and antithesis introduction about Lancelot. He is depicted as ugly and bedraggled in the book, opposing his ideal form. His dedication and the willingness to serve God and Arthur grows throughout the book and we all can see that it's very passionate. I really Miss Merlin's and Arthur's storyline. I would rate it a bit bad than the Sword in the Stone and somewhat better than Queen of Air and Darkness. The main characters are very influential. Especially the women. The women like Elaine and Guinevere also play a central, major, melodramatic, emotional and a strong central role. There are a lot of new knights introduced along with additions to the Orkney faction and Mordred. There are a lot of deaths too. Around 10 new knights and 30 deaths. The chemistry between Lancelot and Guinevere is truly beautiful, it personifies and emphasizes love, want,desires, aspirations and a lot of other things like hatred, jealousy, sin, realization,etc. It brings up human feelings and desires,especially about a women's nature and her wants. Guinevere is portrayed like a crystal clear glass. The characters of Elaine is calm, truthful and dedicated and full of hope. There are a lot of side quests involved with acts of bravery and saviours. Lancelot protects and guards his kingdom and king very well. We don't see much of Arthur just some bits here and there. <br/>What I don't like about the book is the description and detailed emotional plot, lack of action (even though we see many fights), lack of a straight plot, no clear conclusion"" objective, use of unclear and difficult language, hard o understand. Anyway, its an average book but beginners shouldn't read this. Go, do some middle age study and then visit this book. Nice Reading. <br/><br/>I just completed the final book from the Once and The Future King Series by TH White. It is surely a philosophical, emotional, dramatic and a fine book, it is more than a book which makes you reflect upon your thoughts and the causes of war. Unlike, previous books it follows a central and a straight plotline with detailed story. The dialogues and the conversations are impressive, considering the personalities of protagonists and antagonists. Mordred, plays a very important part in here along with Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot and the surviving Orkney faction. There's a lot of deaths in the book. Arthur is a great considerable personality. I opine that its Lancelot's fault due to which the Arthurian Empire crumbled and was divided. The most best thing in the book was the last chapter. It was very moving and philosophical. It just bings back all the memories about Wart and Merlin, his education, mistakes and wars and how they led him to a situation where his wife is kidnapped, his best friend banished, his nephews murdered, his knights assassinated and his own son plotting against him. Whites language is truly beautiful and I would rate the last to chapter alone something that I would remember till I die. This is a wonderful classic that I would recommend to be very sensible book reader. It is a quite delicate topic. I miss King Pellinore, Kay, Ector, Morgan Le Fay, Grummore, and most of all Merlyn. These characters seem to fade away.  There is a lot of detailed unnecessary description too but you could always pass through that. The main idea of the book is how a small mistake can ruin your whole life and all your relations. A very interesting, memorable and a philosophically moving book. Nice Reading",,,1,0

Runin, the protagonist doesn't even act like a Sinegardian graduate anymore. I mean, she's totally dumb, cruel and her persona is only driven by vengeance. The warlords and the empire keep her batting around throughout the book and she's nothing but a minion acting on somebody's behalf, she even gets punished for all her deeds towards her patrons by her patrons themselves. LOL! I mean, this book certainly lacks direction and the plot makes absolutely no sense, but which it lacks in planning and powerful narration, it very well makes it up for with the dialogues and dark thematic storytelling for the most part. Another complaint I have about the book is that some of the dialogue sequences are really petty, this makes this apparently *grimdark* book appear to be a trashy Young Adult novel. There are violent scenes that would freak anyone below 14. Anyways the final five chapters were the most brilliant, but the first ten were disastrously boring and tiresome. I mean, it's just all these characters jumping around, killing pirates, sinking ships and trying to regain their godly powers with absolute no direction following no particular sense of pacing and storyline. On the bright side, I love how Nezha's character has been transformed and rebuilt from the ground up, even the Dragon Warlord amazed me with his crippled sense of judgement and ruthless visage. The world-building and culture of the world is beautifully crafted and brought to life in prose, but most of the time there's a lot of suffering, misery, crying and killing, so on and so forth (NGL, seems a bit overt)<br/>    Wish the characters were a bit more sensible, the plot remained true to the debut book and the foreshadowing was done a bit better and please, better dialogues in the next book. Otherwise, this book hits all the spots right in terms of an epic action sprawling fantasy with the high of constant warfare and politics and the supernatural association with gods that grant unimaginable power. The consequences of the actions of the characters in the first book are heavily resonated here and the aftermath has just horribly crushed the hopes of all citizens. The book had a lot of good, jaw-dropping moments but most of them were near the end of the book. Will stick go 3 star rating for now. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

The first thing that comes to mind after reading the Poppy War is how similar it is the books I've amassed over the years, namely Blood Ninja, Young Samurai and Nevernight(in part). Of course, this book tries to be as original as possible and I'll concede it does, thanks to the extensive world-building. The first book in the 1500 paged saga throws its readers into the midst of the action delivering both emotion and action, sometimes over the top and zealous but entertaining nonetheless. I appreciate the pacing of the story considering how it doesn't waste time in the early years of the Academy going over trivial plot points and shoots straight towards the aftermath. For what it is, this book feels a bit inconsistent in terms of tone. One moment, the protagonist is crying over studies and escaping an abominable marriage, next she's channeling the most violent gods and razing entire islands. I wouldn't go so far as to call this GrimDark but boy, oh, boy does this book have some pretty messed up moments. I've read the Broken Empire Trilogy as well as the First Law trilogy and some moments from this book are so repugnant and gritty it even troubled me . But by all means, it delivers on action, a dark tone and a myriad of world-building elements that any fantasy reader would appreciate. Speaking of the characters, there are some good ones who are well-crafted and the fact that the author has put a lot of work shaping them and giving them a realistic fabric is not lost to me. I thoroughly enjoyed the story when Rinn, Atlan and Chagan were on the front lines. Jiang is a bit tropey but he does have a lot of wise and original  quotes. I enjoyed the poppy war for it's rich world-building, the fast-paced and gruesome action scenes, the political scenario and the early years of Rinn whilst she trained in the academy. The prose is certainly rich and entertaining, the pace shifts at intervals and there is certainly ""Lore"" that will keep you engaged. The story is straightforward, just the way I like it. The major characters are fueled by anger and vengeance and that point drives the story all the time, did I mention how miserable everybody is in this book? The poppy war is all fire and blood and ashes (it tries to be funny sometimes too) in my opinion with lots of  battles and fury and the militaristic elements in the this book sprawl almost every page. It is also spiritual in a sense, talking about culture, history, beliefs of the Empire in great depth-which I like oh, so much! If i were to describe this book in a color palette, I would say it completely contrasts Nevernight. (Nevernight being all dark and shadowy and the Poppy war being all vibrant and lit up with fire all around)<br/>   The climax was the major highlight of the book and sets up Rinn fantastically. I will be starting the Dragon Republic very soon and I'm eager to see how the plot develops, which of my favorite characters will mark thier not-so-surprising return. (Altan, Jiang, Nehze and Venka are bound to return, right?) There is a lot of mystery in the book as well, the author drops a lot of hints on the way to the climax, so there's that too. I hope the following books are just as good or better, I'm sure they will be since Rinn is not a crybaby anymore and we have Chagan by her side. Tiger's Tits! Did I mention the Empress? What's up with her? She might meet her maker in the next volume. This has been a pleasure. Anyways, Nice Reading!",,,1,0

Knopf,Paperback,503,2005,2002,07-06-19,09-06-16,sff,sff (#25),read,"Inheritance Cycle Book 1<br/>*Eragon* by Christopher Paolini<br/>This series has been on my TBR Shelf since eternity and now that I'm diving into this whole new rich and detailed world of Alegaesia I'm awestruck with the incredible talent of Christopher Paolini who apparently drafted this story when he was just 16. The year is 2019 and it is noticeable that the book heavily borrows some classic fantasy tropes and relies on them, EPS. Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc. However, for a book that was written in 2000/2001 this is considerably original and fresh. Right from the first chapter, even though the writing may seem a bit derivative today, the story and the characters are powerful and driving. This is a definitive page turner with almost a high fantasy feel to it. COsidering the page length of the book, I'm pretty much okay with the pacing. The book adds in necessary visual and emotional details where it needs to be while moving the plot forward through action and dailogue all the time. Dragons, prophecies, past and future references, revealtions, magic, mentoring and death is an intrinsic part of the story and it is well dealth with. Almost everything in the book is named-right from Dragons, Swords, Locations to Empires, Alliances, Spells, Potions. The author also sports Dwarfish and Elder Languages-the mechanism of which is unclear to me at this time but it does add a realistic and exotica touch to the exchange of dialogues. The characters development is insane but I'll accept that it is a bit convenient at times. The mechanism of magic on the other hand is certainly well built. I like everything that has to do with magic in the story, right from the introduction to the building up skills required to channel the energy of the Universe and defeat powerful beings is explained exhaustively leaving no stones unturned. A lot of effort has been put in the book, not only the wild story but the writing took. I can only imagine the retires and second drafts sixteen Year old Paolini had to write to make the final copy. The beginning of the book seems very distinct from the ending as the characters have travelled almost halfway through the continent. The Spine and Carvhall are richly developed locations with much of the amateurs excitement and kick off happening there and it would be a pity if Eragon, Sapphira, Arya and Roran do not visit it frequently in the upcoming novels. I really loved the character of Brom (some would argue he's Gandalf's ripoff) who shaped and trained Eragon and revealed to the readers a whole lot of shocking information. Revealtions and Secrets in the book are placed at every 100 pages or so and when they begin they hardly seems to stop. But this gets oh so convincing for the story and I don't think this is a wise choice as it gets repetitive. Revelations and foreseeing the future are an inseperable part of the book. Eragon's journey from a farmer's boy to a dragon rider is worth reading and I definitely recommend this to younger audiences diving into fantasy but this will appeal to older audiences too but not without it being a bit cheesy. Sapphira is perhaps the most adorable and fierce dragon. Not only does she have a telepathic connection with Eragon, her rider but she has an instinct and intelligence of her own which distinguishes her as a female. Also she can pair up and fuel Eragon's magic. This dragon duo dynamic will go a long way in the series and has many unexplored potential paths that the writer could go down to keep the sorry fresh. I liked Sapphira's dailogues and suggestions and her distinct way of thoughts. Murray's secret and his journey and alliance to Eragon is also an exciting part of the book. The story screams out adventure with insane but super realistic battle scenes, enemies and powerful antagonists which raze entire forests. Right from the prologue, the apparent dark forces the here's will be facing off against  are made clear. The author is very serious about the mythology, lore and the locations in this fantasy world complete with a. detailed map which often comes into play as characters travel a lot through a myriad of locations. The last five chapters have an entirely different tone than the rest of the book where Eragon is isolated with Brom/Sapphira's/Murtagh. I'm excited to see Arya rising up the power and aiding Eragon in his destiny. Also, an up close encounter with Galbatorix doesn't seem far away. The magic in the book flourishes with every page. In the final chapters we get to see Eragon's social skills when he interacts with people of various races and of political importance. The Varden has definitely become a force to be reckoned with. The first book in the series, though gives off an amateurish feel is well developed, highly detailed and has immense potential which I'd like to see pay off in the upcoming installments. Here's to the world of Alegaesia and dragon riding experience. Of course, it's in my top 5 Fantasy Series. Moving on to Eldest, Nice Reading!   <br/><br/><br/><br/>----Previous Review------<br/><br/>The book was so much big that it took me about 20 days to read. It is very descriptive, which is sometimes interesting and sometimes really boring. The nature, valleys, landscapes, deserts, cities, architecture, character are described very well. Even the character developing is done in a fine way. There are dragons, dark souls, a great protagonist and a evil antagonist, elf's and dwarfs, princesses and hamlets and villagers, all which suit a high fantasy. Many claim that Inheritance is a Copy of LOTR and Star Wars, it may be but it is done in an exquisite and superb way. The plotlines are great, character quotes are wise and enlightening and you always want to read one more chapter before the day. Algaesia, the fictional world seems so realistic with all those cities and towns folk. I even fine many words difficult to understand, thanks to Kindle that I can define them at a single click. It has helped me improving my vocabulary. I also observed a bond between the characters and the growing relation. Eragon, also trains and learns to survive in this big bad world with help of his friends. I was disappointed after Brom's death. He was like Gandalf.  I'll rate this blooms five stars and I've got the complete series so I'm starting with Eldest now. It was a vast book, I hope the next will be a bit shorter.<br/>Well done, Mr.Christopher. !!!!",,,2,0

Don't get me wrong, loads of important events and milestones are highlighted in the novel but on the while the details appear to intermingle with one another and on the while the plot seems to have barely moved forward for a 600+ pages book. I'm more than satisfied with the enhanced writing (it's more sophisticated, rich, glossy and less cheesy) and delivers exclaimariona, surprises and shocks at regular intervals. I'm glad that Christopher Paolini does not rely much on the prospect of runes and fortune telling as much as he did in he previous book seems to be narrated naturally and not like a second handed informative pamphlet. I can only imagine the work and the dedication that has been put in to write the entirety of the novel and I'm stunned by the sheer and vast loads of fine details (like the name of at least 15 cities, dwarf clans, Eragon's, rituals, gods, poems, artwork, history and the geography of Alegaesia) which have been woven together in a masterpiece. No kidding, theres a fully functional Dwarfish, Elvish language in the play which I do not grasp fully yet. Of course, a majority of fantasy traits are not original but the way they all have been executed is really visionary and speaks a lot about where the story is intended to go. The character development is immense. Not only does the author build heavily upon recurring characters he effortlessly manages to add new characters into the narrative, developing them so much in such short period of time that they spare embedded into the subconscious and it feels as if they have been forever there. The dwarfs and the elves seems too much like that from LOTR. Most of the book invests itself in the journey of individual characters, their conflict, their path of struggle and journey towards newer and fresher developments. Most of the secrets, revelations, battles, epic endings and shocking moments are kept for the final quarter of the book but not to be disappointed, the narrative of the book is such that it as the readers interest in the exploration of cities, Eragon's learning curve, the golden dragon & the mourning sage, the revolution and escape at Carvhall. I'd like to speak more about the three forking narratives that Paolini has now introduced. Of course, Eragon, being the primary character owns most of those we also have Rodan taking a second place with Nassuade owning 6-8 chapters worth and each have a great story to tell. The whole plotline of Roran kept the monotonous journey and training hysteria if Eragon and saved the book. I really like how the common people rise up with a united front with Roran leading them and miraculously overthrowing the powerful minions of Galbatorix. There was a lot of political power in play too with the chemistry between Horst, Katrina, Sloan, Roran and The Raz'ac and the villagers keeping me on the edge of my seat always. The exodus also was a story of epic proportions and finally the reunion between Roran and Eragon was a highlight of the book. Nasuadas narrative didn't strike me as great with her struggling with political powers and overlooking the Varden. The enromous lore concerning the dwarves and elves and the riders if the past seems to be forced upon the readers with cities, tradition and songs about it all. I found it a bit too much to take and would have preferred a battle at the interval. What I found the best in the book was Eragon's training and discovery of his true self and the of course his psychic connection with Saphira. Saphira now apparently drinks too much and courts adult dragons hoping to mate and has a very complex conscience of her own and thusly I adore her character for such a transformative change. Eragon's training and power surge had me all hyped up. Philosophical ideas like religion, veganism, idealistic world, nature of evil and the transcendental entity are all questioned and explored at great depths in the book and appealed to me. The action is considerably less but knowledge and lore of Alagesia and character development have an upper hand in the book. The battle at the Burning plains was of epic proportions. Murtagh's revealtions shocked me and I did not expect things to turn out the way they did. I found Eragon's choices both amusing, shocking and inspiring. We got two more dragons with a hope for a third soon. The battle between Saphira and Thorn blew me away and the final standoff and confrontation with Murtagh was very convincing and well written. Talking about secondary characters, theres too much of them and each play a pivotal role in the story and affect it on the whole. There's not really much time to talk about it all. A well developed book which fills in many gaps and questions and deliver a ton of lore regarding the fantastical world that is Alagesia! Fall a bit short on pacing and action but is enriched by character diversity and philosophy of an ideal fantasy world and common traits. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

A sure-shot classic with all those high fantasy terms. The author has deep knowledge about fundamentals of writing.<br/>2.Time leap of 17 years. Stenwold at Collegium trying to raise awareness about the advancing danger of the Empire. The location switches to Lowlands and primary characters introduced. (Totho, Tynisa, Salma, Che), I’ll call them LL’s (Lowlanders)<br/>3.Stenwold gives a shaking speech to the Collegium, but in vain. The language used is convincing, powerful and effective. Surely not for beginner readers. <br/>4.In depth character traits and personalities are explored. Chapter includes POV’s of the LL’s. Salma writes a letter. Che meditates. Tynisa reveals her ambition. Totho’s parentage is criticized. An applaud deserving chapter.<br/>5.Che pleads to be in the adventure. The Empire’s diplomats arrive at Collegium. Chapter highlights connection between Totho-Che and Salma-Tynisa. The following chapters are insusceptible.<br/>6.Empire’s assailants attack Stenwold and die by the Hands of Che and Tynisa. The plot has begun to advance with momentum. The realization of an impossible task sows seeds in Stenwolds mind.<br/>7.Again, full of bustling action. LL’s successfully flee the hijacked ship of the Wasps a.k.a Empire. It’ll be exciting to see the ‘Art’ of the LL’s.<br/>8.LL’s arrive in Helleron and are apparently betrayed. Tells about the interaction between characters and the overall features of Helleron in detail. <br/>9.The impostor Trick makes appearance. Salma’s history is narrated. Includes witty dialogues and philosophical ideas. Book has potentials. One of the best chapters. <br/>10.Narration by Thalric introduces us to his principals, way of thinking, traits, Tynisa discovers herself at a new place. Thalrics and his minions scene is awesome. <br/>11.Given their current position, the LL’s are sure to stay in Helleron for a couple of chapters. Tynisa settles and reflects girl power radiantly. The LL’s seemingly reunite. Violence is beginning to show and the Dark Magic thing crops up. Complex plot-lines are added. Commonweal culture is described.<br/>12.Tothos narration describes his love for mechanics. Tisamon makes his grand return. Tynisa’s perspective is highlighted. Could have been better but still fascinating. Characters remind me of other characters from other fictional universes.<br/>13.Tynisa bloodbaths. Atheaos appears. Che’s family buys her out to Thalric. Author highlights ideas like gore, betrayal and lust for money. The connection between Che and Acheaos is written remarkably.<br/>14.Acheaos narrates. Che is forced into Empires Jet. Tynisa meets Scuto and reunites with other LL’s. Seems like a filler but the quality of writing is still pretty good, just too much advanced vocabulary.<br/>15.Reunion. Stenwold arrives at Helleron and meets his allies. Atheaos earning importance. Story building up quickly.<br/>16.Empire executes and torches the slave and prisoners. Stenwold discusses about rescue. Chapter highlights the ghastly practice of whiplashes and executions. <br/>17.Tynisa discovers her parentage and her history. Stenwold fills in Tisamon. Revolves around history and Tisamon-Atryssa relationship. Probably, one of the most important chapters out here. Very interesting and full of suspense. <br/>18.Che is mentally and physically harassed and helped by Thalric. Tension builds up. The Empire’s perspective and view of the world depicted firmly. Dialogues are enchanting.<br/>19. Tynisa reveals that she knows her parentage, shocks everybody. A great dialogue scene begins with good play of words and emotional tumult. Elsewhere, Thalric meets the Rekef seniors. Very informative. Too much to take in. Darakyon is terrifying. <br/>20.Gigantic Chapter. Thalric discusses the Empire’s plan and is allotted a mission. Second half is not very clear. Thalric’s nervous behaviour is depicted effectively. Character development seen extensively. Tynisa and Tisamon share blood bond and reward her sword. <br/>21.Atheaos uses his Art and tracks Che in Myna, spends a Long Time to convince LL’s. Generates curiosity. Stenwold deduces a way to enter Myna<br/>22.Ulther appears and his character is so realistic as an aristocrat. Thalric buys a slave and extracts information regarding government of Myna. Thalrics personality is dug into deeper than ever. Che has grown. A rich and vivid chapter.<br/>23.Stenwold and Totho make new acquintaces/allies by meeting old ones and establishing relations. The city of Myna is described richly. The racial diversity is seen distinctly. Very descriptive and informative. Some new prominent character are introduced.<br/>24.Thalric and Che have a brief discussion about revealing the facts of LL’s and the Collegium. I adore Thalric. A larger plan is set into action. Grief in Chains has been given unnecessary importance. <br/>25.Stenwold and the Red Flags leader hold a council and discuss strategies and the immediate threat from the Empire. Weapons and armaments are provided. Tynisa and Tisamon infilitrate Myna tunnels to the castle. Tchaikovsky keeps throwing words I never heard about. Plot-lines intertwine.<br/>26.Thalric steps into limelights and fights off Ulthers assailants. The willingness to murder is prominent. Scenes are turning red with blood.<br/>27.LL’s actually infiltrate the castle and tear down some Wasps and rescue other LL’s. Full of Gore. Khyeena’s character is paramount of Women Power.<br/>28. Biggest chapter, multiple things converge. Showdown between Ulther and Thalric. Art is overused. History and Sins are narrated. Hundreds of Wasps die here. Tynisa is determined to be accepted as daughter. Emotional Turbulence yet again. The book lacks simplicity. <br/>29.Aftermath of Rescue and Battles. Healing and discussion of future. Metting and Ceremonies and Thanksgiving. Thalric frees slaves and demands. Stenwold makes a powerful ally. Well written chapter that brings the reader to a new and refreshing world.<br/>30.Stenwold and Khayna discuss Myna’s revolution and relation with other city states. The uprising is portrayed realistically. Loved the speech by Atheaos in the end.<br/>31.Salma is desperate. Achees character is secondary. Totho is jealous and tries to displace Atheaos. We get to know about something that is not related with the main story and the growing realtion between Atheos and Che and how it influences Totho.<br/>32.LL’s escape from Myna. The Darakyon is depicted as dark and terrifying. This scene is particularly memorable with all the dark and grim atmosphere. Thalric meets Skyla who has possessed another form. Many important factors are unveiled. <br/>33.Unexpected Twist. Thalric meets Scylis who gives him a clue about Scuto. The Wasps and LL’s perfectly know who their enemy is. The real war has begun.<br/>34.Chapter concentrated completely on city of Tharn. Its customs, hatefullness to other kinden, governing bodies and agencies are really scums. Situation of tension is created universally. Not the most important but notable.<br/>35.Stenwold meets Magnates of Hellron to discuss Iron Treaty and how it will affect Tharn. A very important, well written chapter with plot development and deeper character traits. The story is molding and the end is coming.<br/>36.Scuto’s headquarters are desolated by Wasps. Stenwold suffers loses. Che realizes her dreams. Acheaos and Totho clash. The chapter is full of action and emotional scenes.<br/>37.I hated this chapter. Totho’s letter was the only good thing. Again, the complex plots intertwine and the big picture is finally clear. Stenwold has gained power, dominance. <br/>38. Unavailable<br/>39.Perfectly written and balanced. We see action and bombing and battles and blade and sword fights and what not?! We spectate the much awaited battle between Tisamon and Thalric but the latter flees cowardly. The end is kind of Cliffhanger but I’m placing my bets on the fact that Che is alive.<br/>40.The concluding chapter, the shortest chapter, the most influencing chapter. The aftermath of the war is dark and almost everybody is wounded and hurt. Stenwold realizes his struggles have just begun. I worry for Tark, cause the Empire will strike it next. A teaser is added in the ending lines. A very delightful and unique book to read with advanced vocabulary, deep character personalities and action paired with witty dialogues and complex plot-lines.",,,1,0

Some secondary new characters are introduced. Taki, saves a Lowlander ship from pirates on which Che is travelling to Solarno, a miniature Spider City. Taki and Che have a good dialogue but Che s motive to travel to Solarno is not yet revealed. A wonderful beginning.  <br/>2.The story shifts two months back as we see the reunion of Salma and Che with the Collegium members. Salma has become responsible and has his own troop. Acheaos plays a major role as he describes the haunting dreams from Darakyon to Stenwold , Tynisa and Tisamon about the Malign Shadow Box stolen by Scyla. Stenwold asks Thalric, Gaved and Tynisa to go on a quest to retrieve the shadow box. A good chapter where the thoughts and emotions of characters are highlighted. The Character Developments are happening at a rapid pace.<br/>3.Incredible chapter throughout. Just loved it. The words are framed perfectly and are well-balanced, The story keeps shifting and the scene descriptions are enjoyable. Firstly, the characters of Collegium are discussed about. Teornis, the spiderland representative asks Stenwold to protect Solarnis from the wasps as it is the plaything of the Spiderlands. Stenwold hesitantly sends Che and Nero on this mission. Also Acheos brings up the Shadow Box problem and he, along with Tynisa, Tisamon, Thalric and Gaved board an airship of Jon to get back the Shadow Box and prevent it from falling in the bad hands. During the flight, they are intercepted by Moths, when Acheaos confronts the leader of the Skryers and threatens to use the Shadow Box against them. Achaeos shows signs of darkness, he is regarded as the primary character in the chapter. The chapter connects with its predecessor. Awesome story.<br/>4.Chapter dedicated only to Uctebri the Sacrad, General Maxin and Alvdan II from the Empire. Uctebri has been promoted from a slave and his thoughts have become much more vivid. He and Maxin have a competitive and a tensed relation. Maxin s importance in the Empire is highlighted. Uctebri directly controls the Emperor. His though process is underlined. Alvdan and his concubines are portrayed in excess, their politcal importance too. I don t understand why Tserinet killed herself in the end?<br/>5.A bit dull chapter. Che and Nero arrive at the city of Solarnis and the descriptions are detailed and vivid. Che s narrative and thoughts are explored in depth. The political and the social issues of Solarnis along with the Governing body are presented in form of articles. Things are starting to turn out different than expected. Che and Nero seem to be without any assistance in their journey.<br/>6.Chapter mainly focuses yet again on Acheaos, the seer, Gaved the renegade wasp and Thalric the mantis warrior about their particular troubles and their life. Acheaos is enlightened and contacts Che through dreams. Gaved meets an old friend and informs about the Shadow Box. Thalric is still recovering from Empire s betrayal. Entire chapter takes place in Jerez. The main story does not move an inch forward but mainly introduces readers to the characters thoughts and emotions.<br/>7.Che, Taki and company arrive at Solarnis. The culture and the citizenship of Solarnis is portrayed beautifully and with a hint of euphemism, Che and Nero battle the local gang due to some misunderstandings and Che finds a local stranger willing to help them in the great war.<br/>8.Superb, Balkus, the long forgotten character and Destrachis, discuss about Felis Mienn. Stenwold arrives at Sarn and proposes alliance to the Queen but situation changes and the Queen forces Stenwold to submit the snap-bow plans, Salma proposes an alliance by spying and breaking the incoming wasp troops in exchange for the safety of his army. The Queens background is revealed. Felis Mienn and Tisamon's potential relationship is teased. Stenwold has become a puppet in Sarn. Salma has grown courageous. The discussion with thoughts is underlined. Chapter serves as a great side story with major plot developments.<br/>9.Balanced Chapter. The Szar Queen has committed suicide. Uctebri conducts a test and takes Seda  beyond . General Maxin receives news and the internal conflict among the wasp begins. Helleron continues to receive news. I like the first half of the chapter very much. I d like to see Seda becoming the Queen. High language used. Rekef members are brought in the light. There is a particular format to how the story progresses.<br/>10.Could have been more better, but still good enough. Thalric attempts to assist the Empire but is betrayed yet again and gets saved by Tisamon. Tynisa explores the city and is haunted by a shadow. Gaved scenes feel like Movie Extras. The end is surprising. A good chapter with a bit of mystery.<br/>11.Chapter dedicated to only one event. A lot of new characters introduced and a completely new storyline added. Empire has sent Major Tegrec as a new governor of Tharn. The Arcanum unanimously decides to contact him and send their representative Xaraea. Slavery, education, war and other aspects are displayed. The book takes an unexpected and a surprising at the most unexpected moment. The story is defined clearly.<br/>12.Che is centralized. She educates the Solarnis citizens about the threat of the wasps and how they need to strike an alliance and prepare for the great war. A vast tour also takes place where Che is shown the Solarnis regions as Taki poses as her local guide. <br/>13.Absolute Stunning chapter. A new atmosphere is set in Jerez. Scyla is afraid and desperate to sell the Shadow Box. The imperial agent shave been given importance. Major interrogates the lieutenant about the progress of the Shadow Box retrieval mission. Nivit gets a new customer. Tynisa and Tisamon explore jerez and find a deep interconnected network (nexus) of traders and start their mercenary service for Founder Bellowern who is very mysterious. Storyline overlap. The author has a bad habit of transforming simpler stories into complex and intricate patters, but a enjoyable chapter. <br/>14.Beautifully written. Stenwold worries about revealing his Snap-bow plans to Sarn. The representatives of various Lowlands cities arrive at Sarn. The Queen has an audience with Stenwold There is this new character of Lyrus appointed by the Rekef as an assassin who will definitely play a major role in the coming chapters. I think that this book series is completely different from other fictional universes, its like a stand-out with unique aspects included in it. <br/>15.The end was so good! Che and Taki are attacked by Wasp helicopter in their flight returning to Solarnis. Air combat results in Che and Taki crashing and drifting on a tropical island where they meet an assassin and a maniac called Cestra who angers everybody. Che informs that the Wasps will soon hit Solarnis. A wonderful chapter but the beginning is so very dull and boring. The Cestra character got me hooked.<br/>16.Wonderful chapter. Probably the best in the book. A lot of things happen in series and overlap each other. Tisamon and Tynisa defend the Founders place from attackers and unbelievable monsters with the main aim to defend the girl called Sef. She is rescued and brought to Thalric and Gaved who question her and get to know that she came from a different underwater world beneath Lake Limnia in Jerez and she will be hunted by her masters for revealing this particular secret. The future seems to be hanging with an air of mystery. The chapter is filled with solid action. The founders qualities and the tensed atmosphere was practically felt. The second half seems like a mermaid fairy tale. A very oddly entertaining chapter.<br/>17.Delightful. The beginning was predictable but the play of words was delivered fantastically. I pity Stenwold and Co. As they suffer a lot for their good deeds and due to a major misunderstanding of the Ants. I felt it coming. I personally felt bad about Sperra s condition. Stenwold picks up all the bits of courage and builds a tempo. Maxin discovers conspiracy as his army is weakened. The wasps discover that they have internal corruption. A vast chapter,<br/>18.Che and Taki have a word with the wasp Aviator, Axrad who attacked them previously. The chief Rekef of Solarnis has a word with Odyssa as the readers get to know about her spider kinden attitude. The second half of the chapter is much more important as it focuses in the internal misunderstanding between the Empire Leaders. Che is much more dull and her role is monotonous compared to previous book. But an entertaining chapter. <br/>19.Never guessed it would  e so short. Totho s condition is bad as he is crushed form both the sides and is guilty about his sins and crimes. He confronts Kzast who confronts him the newly invented weapon by Drephos, even powerful than the Snap-bow and the news that the Empire will soon march onto her homeland. Their relationship is teased yet again. Trust issues are mentioned. A moderate chapter, worth a quick read<br/>20.A horde of new characters have been recklessly added to the story in this and the preceding chapters. All of them belong to the Rekef and Empire and are employed at certain post. Gan informs Berdic that he s facing the opposition of Solarnis citizens and Szar is getting revolutionary. I don t think it would be nice to add any new characters so soon. The primary plot is forgotten. It also shows how women are empowered. An average read.<br/>21.We are back with the primary story taking place and it is totally beyond imagination. Acheaos discovers the pinpointed location of Shadow Box. Scyla is aware of this. Also another mage is trying to hunt this shadow box. Acheaos, Tismaon, Tynisa, Gaved, Thalric arrive at Scyla s residence and battle with her mercenaries and minions until Acheaos face the powerful mage and Scyla escapes nearly killing both of them. I like the traits of the Renegade mage and his powers. Nice combat and Tactics. The end and the beginning link together. Looking forward to reach the end soon .<br/>22.Oh. Things are lighting up with fire now. Odyssa reveals much more about her vice thoughts and ambitions and the personality of Spider Kinden People. I liked Che s dream sequence, wherein she dreams about Acheaos. Taki, Che and Nero try to escape the city as it is being bombed by the Empire. Lot of Fire and Blood. General Axrad returns and challenges Taki. To tell the truth I m much more interested in the Shadow Box plot. Aviation sequence was nice.<br/>23.An average chapter with things advancing a bit but not much progress in the main story. General Maxin fears his flaws being pointed out. Princess Seda is proud of herself and is seeing herself in a  different manner. Much more bold, beautiful and ambitious. She also trusts Uctebri now, who has given her this power. She has word with her assistant. She has a dialogue with a general which binds him to her. Next, we see Drephos who is building up a lot of Snap-bows and receives a letter summoning him to Szar from the Empire. He decides to take all his work there. Plot advances slowly. A lot of technical words and high vocabulary used.<br/>24.Wonderful and mazing chapter. A lot things happen in sequence and the primary narrative is pushed forward. Tisamon is mad at himself for thinking about Felis. He and the whole group visit the auction where Thalric recognizes Scyla, who is now disguised. Gaved s feeling for Sef are unveiled. Nivit, who had planned to trade Sef to her owners helps her escape as he dives into the water and retrieves the drowning Shadow Box to Acheaos which fell during the combat between Thalric and Scyla and where the Wasps intercepted them. We have a lot of action scenes connected together and we see the legendary underwater monsters coming on the group. Different aspects are mixed together. <br/>25.The penultimate chapter was far from what I thought. Stenwold returns to the Collegium and has a discussion of his progress with Teornis and Thadspar. Che and Nero manage to get on the Cleaver and escape with a lot of bloodshed and are helped by Cestra who eliminates all the wasps in their way.. Taki successful, while aviation defeats Axrad. With repairs all the Solarnis characters get back on their and leave for the Collegium. The secondary characters will be eliminated.<br/>26.We see that the final chapter changes the story completely. IF it has been anything, it has been surprising. I bet anyone could never suspect what was coming. Brodan returns from the lake and despairs that he couldn t be successful in his Rekef mission of retrieving the Shadow Box but is confronted by a Mosquito Witch that she will get it back for him. Acheaos, with all his curiosity opens the Shadow Box and temporarily traps the elite team within the Darkyon where they encounter Uctebri, the Sacrad who gives them a hint of his power. The witch possesses Tynisa and tries to kill Acheaos and is successful in teleporting the Shadow Box to Uctebri before being killed by the Lowlanders. Tisamon explains Tynisa about the importance of her sword. Tynisa and Acheaos are guilty of their own mistakes. The Darakyon sequence was just wonderful with the dark and grim tale theme. Brodan finally gets the Shadow Box, thanks to Uctebri witch and prepares to deliver it to the Empire. A wonderful and a surprising end to book 3. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

The ancestral history and other data is also presented. Its good to see the Emperor of Wasps. Back at the Collegium we see Thalric meeting with the Wasp spies and after the loss at the ‘Pride Battle’ he conspires to murder Stenwold Maker. A very notable and a solid chapter with a quick recap.<br/>2.We see some new character which were only mentioned in the previous book and their interaction with other characters. This chapter was not very enjoyable. Elsewhere in Tark we see Totho, Salma and Skrill fighting some wasp enemies and getting caught. Personally, I think this was an unnecessary addition. <br/>3.An enjoyable chapter with a quick recap of the first novel. Stenwold with the help of the Council has planned some moves as he is aware that the Empire is playing a game. Stenwold allots quests to the LL’s (Lowlanders). Balkus is interrogated about his loyalty.<br/>4.Salma is interrogated by the ants and meets Nero, the artist. I think that the Ants overestimate themselves too much. The staunchly powerful character of Felise Mienn, a Dragonfly Kinden Woman is introduced as she extracts information from Hokiak. Bargaining and slaughter is presented. The dialogues are shaking and strong. The way characters think is wonderful.<br/>5.We see some real action starting. Salma has a comparatively good experience at Tark as he is freed. The generals and the commanders discuss the war strategies. Attack on Tark begins.<br/>6.It feels good to be back to the narrative of Tisamon and Tynisa as they have a friendly battle at the Collegium. Che, Acheos and Scuto continue their journey to Sarn. Arianna pleads to help Stenwold in his task. Human emotions are highlighted strongly with descriptive scenery. <br/>7.Very important and notable chapter. Revolves only around Emperor Alvdand and his sister Seda as they discuss their relations. Seda meets Uctebri, the mosquito kinden sorcerer. The chapter is dark and grim. Alvdan is like a glorious villain willing even to murder his sister. The revelation of the Mosquito Kinden is icing on the cake which is totally surprising.<br/>8.Thalric collects report from the Rekef general. The plot thickens as Arianna’s loyalty is revealed towards Thalric and hat she works as a double agent to extract Stenwold's plans. Arianna’s character is explored in depth. Spider kinden mentality is criticised.<br/>9.The characters are becoming too much complicated with a number of Generals, Commanders and Majors in the Empire. Drephos informs Edric that its the perfect moment to attack the city of Tark in order to win it. The battle begins much to the advantage of the Empire. Totho and Skrill survive a lot of bombing and bloodshed. Salma shows his courage as he wades in deep and assuming slays Edric. A chapter full of bombing, air war and violence. <br/>10.Felis Mienn is given an education about Helleron and the Collegium which acts as a brief recap. At Collegium, Arianna works her politics and gets the order to hand over Stenwold or assassinate him immediately. Arianna has been given a lot more importance. Stenwold and Tisamon’s dialogues are beautiful but the end was expected,<br/>11.Alder praises but shows his hatred for DarinDrephos ‘Drephos’, the Auxillian of the Wasps. Totho, Salma and the Tarkesh army discuss war strategies to survive. A very fine rigmarole is presented. The ruins, the spoils and the aftermath of the war are portrayed realistically.<br/>12.Che and Acheos arrive at Sarn where they meet Scuto and another meaningless discussion takes place. Sarn is vividly described as Acheos takes Che and forges an alliance for the Lowlands. Not a notable chapter but the story is moving and Che is back in the lead. <br/>13.The game has begun and the story gained momentum. The chapter opens with duels between Tynisa and Pireus, we get to see a lot of combos and blood spilling everywhere thanks to Tisamon smashing everyone. Bolwyn also rescues Stenwold from Thalric and his unsuccessful cronies. Thalric discloses Plan 2.  and proposes alliance with Vek. Alliances have gained a lot of importance. Stenwold prepares to give a speech directed at the Assembly with maximum effect. <br/>14.Stenwold gives his speech to the Assembly, very inspiring and effective. Arianna meets up with other old friends from variety of kinden and together for their benefit they all conspire to assassinate Thalric to prevent him from reaching Vek. Stenwold is guilty and is depressed due to his old age. Many aspects of fantasy are highlighted. The story direly needs to shift its locations. <br/>15.Totho and Salma along with the other rulers of Tark have a discussion about the battle and gaining advantage to defeat the Empire. They also talk about Totho’s feeling’s for Che. Basila, the army head appoints a team to infiltrate the Empire army at night and the attack begins. Totho and Salma seem very distant and different from their previous character traits. <br/>16.A very interesting chapter with unexpected turn of events. Arianna escapes Thalric and is found by Tisamon who also meets with Felis Mien, during which they both clash and the Mantis meets a worthy opponent. Arianna hints that Thalric is moving towards Vek. She also reveals that she wants to inform Stenwold about Thalric.<br/>17.Finally, the book is getting a lot better. The large scale battle between the Ants and the Wasps concludes, taking with itself ashes and dust of the dead. Basila’s potential death. Totho is interrogated in a friendly manner by Drephos, his artifice skill is brought into limelight. Chapter is a cliffhanger. Story is finally moving and developing. <br/>18.We are back to the Emperor’s narration. I truly anticipate this book and its creative writing style. Emperor orders Uctebri to take waht he wants from Seda and sends a trustworthy group to fetch the Shadow Box from the Collegium to complete the immortality ritual. The story is taking a darker turn. Seda will surely be empowered in future. <br/>19.Thalric arrives at Vek. The tier system of the Empire is clearly portrayed but is too confunsing. Vekken lifestyle is described vividly. The internal politics concerning Thalric are brimming. Its difficult to keep track of the newly introduced characters.<br/>20.This chapter is dedicated entirely to Totho. A very informative and nice chapter which reflects the ghastly practises of the Wasps. Drephos praises Totho for his artifice skills and asks him to join his cadre. The Bee Kinden gives a shaking speech, very important. Tark is burnt ot ashes. The book is getting much better, thanks to great dialouges and play of words.<br/>21.This chapter was vast. Every series of possible events is happening all at once and new characters are introduced nonstop. Collegium after getting enlightened about the danger, are still hesistant to send Tynisa and Tisamon to Spiderlands to make potential allies. A very notable part. Also Helleron is subdued and captured by the Wasps.<br/>22.Tark is annexed by the Empire. It feels like the Wasps are capturing everyhting and ruining the order. The chaaracter of Parops in brought into limelight. <br/>23.Very entertianing chapter. Salam has identity crisis but quickly recovers. Many psychological traumas are discussed. He is broken but still hopes and dreams about Grief in Chains. Totho has been cast into a dillema where he is now the apprentice of Drephos and has a new life. The book takes unexpected turns and the story is beyond praise.<br/>24.Everything is desolated and there’s much less hope for the Lowlands now. Totho confronts Salma. Sperra has a council with Queen. Che and Acheos strike a bargain with the Arcanum. The LL’s discuss the advance of the Empire at Scuto’s place. A developing chapter where alliances are struck and philosophical ideas are presented. <br/>25.Wonderful chapter. The plot goes off the main line as the Spider Kinden discuss the attack of the Empire on Spiderlands and have a serious argument with the Wasps. The event is notable. We see Totho and company arriving at Helleron and working at the industries to develop modern high tech weapons for the Empire. A solid Ten Rating.<br/>26.The chapter is thronged by characters. Stenwold makes a desperate move of naval bombing to defend Collegium. Vekken troops fall due to this. Not a well balanced chapter but the story moves forward quickly. I have high hopes that we have a character recap. (NEVER READ THE BOOK WITHOUT PAYING ATTENTION OR THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS)<br/>27.Salma gets back his identity and involuntarily becomes the leader of the refugee group. Serves as a side story.<br/>28.Follows Stenwolds narration as the collegium braces against another Vekken attack. Arianna is freed by Sten. His feeling and emotions are displayed neatly. The story has surpassed simplicity but is stuck at a single location<br/>29.Tis and Tynisa enter Felyal, the Mantis hold. Tynisa undergoes a test where her mental and physical abilities are broken. She gains the brooch of the weaponmaster but anyone hardly appreciates her. Tisamon has hardened himself. Tynisa’s weakness are exploited. <br/>30.Salma steps into light as he discovers his importance in the great games of the Wasps. He discusses the porgress with the bandits. Totho is forcefully made to use the newly discovered powerful snapbows. It is beyond my thinking how little and small characters have been empowered by Mr. Tchaikovsky. <br/>31.Amazing chapter full of great scenes. Members of collegium commit a mass suicide. Stenwold feels neglected and dipressed and seeks the help of Magician Nepropholis. Also we see Thalric’s condition worsen in the army. Drephos and Felis are also tensed.<br/>32.Chapter is beautifully reach and reaches its maximum potential. Spider kinden politics along with father-daughter duo wading across the Darkyon are notable parts. Tynisa’s fast paced duel are delightful. The dialouges and action are main highlights.<br/>33.Slama gives a hardcore speech about his love for family and Collegium. The scene shifts with Thalric potentially being executed as per as the Rekef order. Thalric realizes that he has been fighting for the wrong side and flees with a quick battle but is captured by Felis.<br/>34.Another series of amazing events hapopens. The scenes are vibrant and exciting. Tisamon and Tynisa discuss the alliances with Spider Commander. An amzing exchange of dialogues. Che and the Ants watch as the Mantids enter Sarn and strike an alliance with the queen.<br/>35.A unique chapter. First we see weakened Vekken enemies colliding Collegium for the last time and beig destroyed due to their own flaws. The battle is portrayed practically and pragmatically. I hust love the role of Stenwold and Balkus. Next we have the Shadow Box being stolen from the Collegium by Scyla and a chaos eruption. Scyla, relaizing the true value of the Shadow Box after practically being harassed by it decides to sell it at a higher value. A well planed, important and a notable chapter.<br/>36.Chapter is monotonous and boring with just a dozen of translation and battle scenes. Ants and Wasps Clash. Vekken and Collegium battle. Achoes is haunted by something far greater than he could imagine. <br/>37.Probably the shortest chapter. Collegium can barely hold the incoming Vekken assult. The Collegium citizens die at an alarming rate. I still don’t understand why the book has been titled, ‘Dragonfly Falling’. The story is surprising as the dark times arrive. <br/>38.What a royal mess Mr. Adrian has made. Or rather call it a pandemonium. The story is very dull now and intolerable. Only siege engines, battles and bloodshed without any actual ecitement. Scuto and others die. Che and Acheos get hurt. Things are turning out to be very complicated.<br/>39.Collegium’s alliances arrive and duly save it from the invasion. The aftermath is portrayed beautifully. Fianlly, the Coucnil identifies its errors and mistakes at underestimating Stenwolds opinion. Thalric arrives and seeks the help of Stenwold and accepts that he is surrounded by enemies.Cheerwell’s death is teased again. The things are getting clear now.<br/>40.Absolutely stunning. Thalric puuts forward a helpful proposal of recuing Che. Tynisa and Tisamon return to Collegium, at the same time the Mantids raid the Waps army and completely desolate it. This exhange of dialouges and the attack happening all at once are truly wonderful. Felis Mien arrives to seek her revenge. Tynisa has changed a bit. Conditions are getting harder fpr Thalric. Stenwold tries to administer anything. Amzing chapter with tension building up and conflicts cropping up.<br/>41.Quite Small chapter. The story shifts focus to Che as she lies trpapped in the stinking cells of the Wasp Empire and is held captive for further interrogatoin. We see Totho arriving and talking to her about his broken future and a mess that he has made of himself by shedding a lot of blood of the innocents for the Empire. He is not guilty that he has walked upon the dark path. He confronts Che and tells her that they are enemies now. Uctebri, in his highly elequont speech report to Alvdan ii that things have taken a nasty turn and the Shadow Box is in the right hands. A very entertaining part of the book.<br/>42.Thalric and Felis clash but obviously Thalric looses due to his wounds and is saved by Felis’ assistant as he reveals that Felis had misinterpreted the person who killed her husband and she herself in her mad rage ended her family lineage. A wonderful chapter. Che gives an inspiring speech to Totho. She is shocked to confront the darker version of Totho but recognzing thier friendship he gives her the blueprint of the Snapbow as the last chance of the Lowlands to survive agains the coming storm. <br/>43.What an unexpected happy ending. Things have turned really good for all the characters. Drephos is happy that Totho has provided the Ll’s with the Snapbow draft so that the Empire approaches the duo to ask for greater weapons and provide them greater resources. Che is captured by Gaved and traded to the bandits who turn out to be Salma and both are happy for theri reunion. An amazing book with lot of battles, campiagns, paranormarl activities and most importantly elequont speeches and praiseworthy dailouges. Does’nt feel like the second book of the series due to the interconnected complex plotlines. Amazing book with an incredible story.<br/><br/><br/>",,,1,0

Now about reviewing the actual book, I just wanteda  getaway from the cliche novels and I was so bored that my reading life had come to an unexpected halt and I'm glad to say that this book has got me back and helped me kickstart my reading goal for this year. You have to agree, that the trilogy is a massive chunk with each book averaging at least 450 pages and that's a lot but when you have an audiobook aid with smooth narration which works perfectly even at a 2x speed you are bound to feel invincible, aren't you? The book began very well with a highly fast-paced action sequence introducing one of the many protagonists to come, Logen Ninefingers(who has at least 5 more aliases) fighting off Shankas (devoid orc like creatures) and his life goes into a downards spiral thenceforth with his band assumed to be dead. Glokta,the Imperial torture master with his painful misery as a constant companion acting under the orders of once-green behind the ears officers but with ulteriror motives hidden underneath the grim cellars. Logan Jezal, the thrid of the protagonist is a yound reckless, free-spirited warriror of the Union training his ass off for the upcoming swordfight tournament and his life takes a sudden turn as Ardee, a young beautiful maiden enters his heart and things get complicated thenceforth. Bayaz, the magical being of a race now forgotten and dwindling and his apprentice Quai journeying towards the Union to play a part in the upcoming war and the duo of the wizard and his bitter accoplice Ferro, a rough girl seeking vengence against the soldiers who cut down her kin. It's a wide cast and you'll be able to see the chemistry between them as soon as the first half of the book is over and the characters converge for one particular question rasing quest. I would like to say that The first installment of The First Law is an unadulterated prologue to the trilogy, in no way attempting to be a complete novel that stands on its own. It’s a huge achievement. Most of the book is dedicated to the major character development and making the readrs believe that they actaully exist by adding layers to their traits with each passing chapter, with every single quote it's not hard to recognize the building depth and originality of the charcters. Mr. Joe even mocks some major fantasy traits and brings  a much necessary and loved twist to it making it seem like a grim, underlying parody. This book series deserves as much attention as ASOIAF and HP because even though it's a take on fantasy there are so many relaistic elements like misery, sadness, guilt, bloodlust, lust, envy, sacrifice and death at every turn of the page and it is most certainly an adult novel. I don't recommend to the young 'uns not because there's blood and gore and constant use of the f-derivates but because the novel has elements and factors which are much beyond your years and need a certain maturity for complate grasp about what the author wants to portray. The book was very well-planned, intricate and exciting. There's not much action but when there it itsteals the show, it truly does. The confrontations between the characters is something to look out for. I could really understand Glokta and found his introducing chapters and other chapters in the first half of the book very thrilling and relatable. Bayaz is also an original personality to look out for. I really can't understand Ardee's motives maybe becuase she's a woman but the tragic events between her and Jezal captured my attention. The first and the second law are introduced along with multiple locations spanning over thousands of kilometers and the history of the mages is also revealed adding a much needed depth to the fantasy. The story is a bit slow and divided into mutiple narratives but I'm not complaining, in fact I love how sluggish the story really is becuase as the characters are being developed at a very higher rate it will be so much fun when the war actually brekas out in the following installments it will be super fun to relate to the characters we know and that are so realistic and that's something for the next books in the trilogy. I loved the narration by Mr. Joe(actually it's a POV but still the man does write from the characters heart and attains a highy desried effect on the reader of convincing the depth of the situation and that truly talented) I would like to end this rant on a note that this well-planned novel has much depth and appeal to it. It converges many themes and characters of multiple personalities for one epic storyline that deals with a super-amazing trope amalgam relying on secondary world building and witty quotes at each page. Really loved it. Much thanks to the Ted Reread hosted by *Justin Landon*, you added so much depth and dynamic to my reading experience, Nice Reading!",,,1,0

The book fluctuates between the narratives of Todd and Viola, unlike its predecessor and also the characters seem completely different as if you are reading a completely new series, mainly because they do not retain their original traits that we observed in the Knife of Never Letting Go! I found this book very similar to the Hunger Games Series (Mockingjay) particularly. The president/mayor, the Madam Coyle seem very similar to President Snow and Madam Coin and the dilemma and the situations are quite similar too. I'm only saying that the fundamentals may be copied but the story retains its original and compelling narrative with the ''Sound'' and ''Noise'' of the people and especially it focuses on the ability to bend and control and demonstrate the power of the ''Noise'' of Todd(Protagonist) and the President (The Antagonist). The story is exceptionally well planned but may seem monotonous sometimes. Even, i really miss the escape and chasing through the forest like the previous book and Todd seems more mature and a completely different person, so there! It clearly omits some valuable elements from the previous book and adds another ''Fugitive'' and ''Captive'' law from the story. The story begins exactly at the cliffhanger where it was left off, where Todd and Viola are imprisoned in the new Prentistown , the ex-haven and how they both manage to escape and join two different paths of the organization of the Ask(An organization of the President, Established in order to vanquish the Answer), and the Answer (Established by Mistress Coyle in order to end the tyranny of President through bombings and revolts), I love  the way the two organizations and their interactions from the title of the book. The dialogues are witty, economical, philosophical, and very captivating and if there aren't too many dialogue then there are action scenes that will thrill you. The book has a more modern touch, with bombings and spaceships and guns and what nots? directly contrary to the Knife of Never Letting Go. Viola has become a very important, influential and powerful character that completely changes the storyline.Many new characters are revealed here like the healing society, the horde of Spackles, the Ask, The Answer, Mistress Coyle, Lee, Davy Prentiss (Who plays a very important part in the book), Major Hammar, The Armies of both the organizations, Lee, Mayor Ledger, etc. etc. The main idea of the book is love and war and finding a good way to establish peace. There's a lot of blood and gore too and another cliffhanger that will surely amaze you. And there's a whole lot more of Spackles that you saw previously! Nice Reading!!",,,1,0
2118745,"The Knife of Never Letting Go (Chaos Walking, #1)",Patrick Ness,"Ness, Patrick",,1406310255,9781406310252,5,3.97,Walker,Hardcover,479,2008,2008,20-04-17,15-04-17,sff,sff (#8),read,"Chaos Walking Book 1<br/>*The Knife of Never Letting Go*<br/>Absolutely Stunning! I've been looking forward to read this book since I saw it rest on around 20 of my Goodreads friend's favorite shelf. So I thought, I'd give this a shot. And this was just way more than I expected. The Knife of Never Letting Go is the first and foremost book in the Chaos Walking Trilogy and the debut work of the author Patrick Ness. He surely has done a great work for his debut! The book is set in a dystopian world (Opposite of Utopia, ''Paradise'')where everybody can hear the thoughts of everybody. So there's always a big chaos of noises and no privacy or silence at all. I cannot even remotely imagine how people can live in such surroundings. This is probably the most unique idea about the book that changes the total storyline and is an extremely, probably the most important factor that influences the readers and the fictional characters within the book. Extremely well done!! The book revolves around a young boy Todd and his encounters in the ''new world'' that its like a life planet like the Earth. I think the story takes place in the near future. It is mostly a thriller and an action book with a hint of sci-fi and unnatural philosophy. If you ask me to describe this book in a single word I would just reply: UNIQUE!!!<br/>This  book was big, surely, like about 450 pages which took me 5 days to read. But it was surely worth it with well planned storyline,(sometimes may seem monotonous), realistic and emotionally imbalanced characters (as they are teenagers), clearly defined geographical regions, depiction of natural factors, action, gore, violence, emotional tumult, a lot of swearing, escapes, discoveries and a lot of new exploration and experiences. The major characters like Todd and Viola and Aaron(The Bad Guy) have been shaped exceptionally well but there are some moments in the book which are quite monotonous due to which it may lose its impression in certain readers minds. The New World includes settlements like Prestistown, Haven and others along with forests and clearings and marshes where most of the story occurs. The New World is crystal clear with its own primitive inhabitants, namely the Spackles who are harmless. The story weaves around a very sensitive and the author endeavours to give the most satisfaction to the reader. Even the style of writing is extremely different from the mainstream fiction novels that we see now-a-days. It's unique and exemplary in its own way. The Quotes, dialogues, the style of narration, development of characters and the action scenes just addicts you to read more and more. Here are some recorded and noted facts about the book that seemed interesting to me.  Each year in the NW(New World) = 13 months. Todd=13 years=14years of the Earth.<br/>The word 'Noise' is always written in capital, which may refer to it being like Time or like a God.<br/>The style of writing is completely different from mainstream novels. Especially, the dialogues. You may get the main idea bout the book a bit late but when you get it, I'm totally sure you will surely devour this story.<br/>Age of characters are sometimes given in months and years. There's a lot of words and scientific terms relating to the NW that could not be found in the Kindle Dictionary, so the author may be trying to establish an independent set of words for the NW.  There are a lot of spelling mistakes, abbreviations and apostrophe dialogues (Done Purposely) symbolizing the new eruption of language style in the NW. Even, basic and primary figure of Speech are utilized in the story and dialogues. Mostly, at a critical moment in the story, the narration is done in incomplete sentences in a vertical order rather than the usual horizontal style of writing. Each chapter brings up a different issue and presents it in a variety of way. Eg. Chapter 2 gives the detailed geographical areas and characteristics of Prentistown. There's a good standard of gore and violence, not in a dark manner but surely in a saddening but enjoyable way. The action scenes are just remarkable, especially the combat narration and the fighting. At times, the book builds a scary/fearful atmosphere and delivers a huge surprise that isn't so scary. Girls and women are depicted and described as an alien organism that have been extinct in the NW. It just adds up to the mystery. (You will understand this after you read the story, don't want to give ya spoilers). There's a lot of old tongue used like 'ya', 'yer', 'gonna', ''Coz', etc. I would say that the most important thing while reading this book is choosing a suitable and a silent environment. Silence is most important. You need to digest and comprehend every single letter if you want the bliss of the book. The entry of Viola is just great, it adds up to the magic and the mystery to the plot. There is logical reasoning emotional analysis for every move that Todd makes. He is so realistic being a teenager and presents his thoughts very well. NW has two moons. Every article or tool has got a funny name with a queer but original narration which makes it addictive. The author delivers a same singular message but in a variety of ways and dialogues which gain tempo and makes us smile and laugh even in the most terrible situations. The moment Viola starts speaking is just very surprising and she keeps on talking a lot later. I wonder why she was so quite for the first six chapters. There are numerous moments in the book when Todd understand the truth about his life. He is surprised to know that his whole life was just a false statement, there are moments when what he believed was not true and what he did not believe was so much true. Strong hints of middle English dialects present. Presence of astrological term. Ness has created his own universe very near to perfection with realistic landmarks, at times it feels as if you are playing an openworld/sandbox video game. Except it's a story. Each and every conclusion of chapter has made me smile. Every chapter is ended so wonderfully. After 60% the book highlights many survival and life skills. In between, Todd suffers from multiple personality disorder which is creepy as he sees his own reflection with a pessimistic outlook standing right in from of him and trying to discourage him. He even suffers from cold, cough, fever and virus. Viola plays a big deal throughout the book. Tood uses the knife, which is very influential and almost alive as his melee weapon throughout the book. Its a very sad and emotional moment when Manchee, Todds dog is killed by Aaron. Even the character of the dog is so well that you are left in pain after the tragedy. The story is full of unexpected surprises and unthinkable plot. It almost feels like experiencing a roller coaster ride. At the end of the book, the plot gains a sudden tempo. Aaron clearly depicts all the pictures and gives the complete idea of the whole story. The ending with Viola killing Aaron and saving Todd from becoming a ''man'' is also well planned. Towards the conclusion of the book you can clearly observe a hints of philosophical ideas and emotional reasoning! The antagonists of the book are purely indestructible and invincible. The end is just unexpected and what reader may never expect but may be disappointing for some.  But a very well panned, well written, unique, thrilling book that made me smile even at the most tough time. I'm definitely gonna pursue the chaos walking series. Nice Reading!!&#x1f64c;&#x1f618;&#x1f60e;&#x1f607;",,,1,0

I was literally shaking while reading the last sentence, ''Keep Calling Viola, Cuz here I come', this book is astonishingly the best dystopian Fantasy book that I have read in my life. Even if I read a thousand more stories they wouldn't give me the feeling that this book did. It is complicated, philosophical, emotional and makes you think about peace and how to live life. Its the first time a Fantasy book has shook me so much. Absolutely fantastic and remarkable. As compelling as it is original. This is the third book in the Chaos Walking Trilogy as you must have already known. Here, 3 characters narrate the plot, namely our major Protagonist Todd Hewit a.k.a The Knife, Viola Eade and finally a Spackle branded as 1017 a.k.a The Return a.k.a The Sky. I never though 1017 would be a major charachter in the book but Patrick Ness gives you things that you never imagine, even in your dreams. The book starts of from where it was left of previously, when the Spackle charge against the people of the New Prentisitown and later about the efforts of the Mayor, Todd, Viola and Mistress Coyle to attain peace for once and for all for the betterment of the world. But things turn very nasty as various characters realize their own needs and their own monsters hiding beneath them and unleash them at the moment of truth and destroy everything that they hoped for. It is a very powerful philosophical book that is also fun to read, with witty dialogues, facts about humanity, humanism and human feelings and emotions. Let no my words demotivate you to read this book! There are a lot of action scenes, combat scenes, Noise Wars, Witty humour and dialogues that just blow away your mind. I really wonder how much the characters have grown since I started this series. It has really influenced me and changed the way I think, this book is unique if anything. I would strongly recommend you to read this book as fast as you can withing 3-4 days and that's really difficult as it is a bit more than 500 pages but still worth everything and better than I have read so far. The Mayor is another attraction, I bet no other author could frame and develop such a influential and moving anti-hero such as the Mayor David of the New Prentistown. He is formidable, powerful, dominating and a lot more scary if you let him out of hands. I cannot explain the feeling in words. The end is particularly nice and there's a bit of mystery at the conclusion that Ness leaves to the reader to figure out. This is truly a bookbuster. Viola and Todd finally realize their motive in the world and how it works. Patrick Ness has personified human characters and shaped them in such a way that they will please you and also they will make you think and reflect upon the way you live. The dialogue 'Wars make monsters of men' is essentially true. The book also gives us a message of peace and harmony. I bet I'll remember the last sentence in the series, 'Keep Calling Viola, Cuz Im Coming' till eternity and why that is so I'll leave it for you to find out! Ness is nothing more than a God for me now! Thanks for writing such a good material. Readers stop scrolling, and purchase a copy of The Monsters of Men and I bet you will devour this book.  In the end it really make you realize how much our young heroes have worked to attain peace. Extremely Well planned, Excellent and remarkable beyond words book. Nice Reading!",,,1,0

Spanning over 130 pages with landscape illustrations at regular intervals with Merlin, Lancelot, Arthur and the adventures of the Knights of the round table depicted are a pleasure to the eye. As far as I know, the story was brief, to the point and aracterized by the essential Arthurian Spirit that s reminiscent in the modern age. The entiriety of the life of King Arthur is divided into seven chapters with two of them focusing on secondary characters like Lancelot, Percival (or Percivale) as he's called in this book and Galahad. I read this book and enjoyed it but the pure motive behind this as to catch up witht he forgoteen key details surrounding the life and legend of King Arthur. This is an all agefriendly book that I'll certainly recommend for children thanks to it's unspoilt and to the point narrative.

Lyra is lost and Will needs to search for her in order to stop the Dust from vanishing and leaving the Earth into an Oblivion. Lord Asriel commands and rallies his forces against the 'Authority' to end the game for once and all. An amazing journey in a multitude of Parallel universes. A literary delight.<br/><br/>{Storyline}-   Coulter keeps her daughter Lyra drugged in a remote cave hidden from the Magisterium, a theocratic authority determined to kill Lyra to prevent her from causing a new fall of man. Lyra dreams she meets her dead friend Roger in the land of the dead, and promises to help him.<br/>In Cittàgazze, a city in a parallel world, angels Balthamos and Baruch are instructed to take Lyra's friend Will to Lord Asriel, whose army are preparing to fight the Magisterium, but Will refuses until Lyra is rescued. When they are attacked by a soldier of the archangel Metatron, Will uses the subtle knife, which has a blade so sharp it can cut windows into other worlds, to escape. Baruch delivers a message to Asriel, but dies from wounds sustained fighting angels loyal to Metatron.<br/>The Magisterium sends an assassin, Father Gomez, to follow the physicist Mary Malone, hoping that Mary will lead him to Lyra. Mary goes through another window into a world where she meets sapient, elephantine creatures called mulefa who use large seedpods attached to their feet as wheels. She learns that the seedpod trees have been dying out for centuries. Mary uses the tree sap lacquer to construct a spyglass that allows her to see the particles known as dust, which is no longer nourishing the trees that the mulefa depend on. Will meets Iorek Byrnison, king of the armoured bears, who are migrating south to avoid the Arctic melt caused by Lord Asriel's experiments. Will impresses Iorek by destroying his helmet with the subtle knife, and Iorek agrees to help rescue Lyra. Will, Iorek, Balthamos, Asriel's army and Magisterium forces converge on Mrs Coulter's cave, where Will wakes Lyra. As he cuts a window into another world, Mrs Coulter's sudden arrival reminds him of his sick mother, which breaks his concentration, and he shatters the knife. He and two Gallivespian spies, Tialys and Salmakia, escape with Lyra to another world. Iorek repairs the knife. Lyra, Will, Tialys and Salmakia travel to the world of the dead to fulfil Lyra's promise to Roger. They are forced to leave their dæmons behind, causing them enormous pain. After they find Roger, they strike a deal with the harpies: in exchange for allowing them to open a window so the dead can escape, the harpies will hear the stories of the dead, and may bar access to those who have not lived full lives. The dead step through and dissolve, reunited with the universe. Will and Lyra must return to Asriel's realm to retrieve their dæmons; Will's dæmon, previously invisible, is now visible. They are joined by the ghosts of Will's father and Lee Scoresby, who decide to remain intact to join Asriel's army and fight the spectres, wraith-like creatures that devour adult souls. The battle between Asriel's army and the forces of the Authority begins. Mrs Coulter, who has allied herself with Asriel, enters the Authority's citadel, where she meets the Regent Metatron. She leads Metatron to Asriel, but betrays him, uniting with Asriel to attack Metatron. All three fall into an abyss and cease to exist. Will and Lyra free the Authority from Metatron's crystal prison, but he is so feeble that the atmosphere dissolves him. With the help of the Gallivespians, armoured bears, and ghosts, Lyra and Will find their dæmons and escape to the mulefa world, where the short-lived Gallivespians die. They encounter Mary, who tells them why she stopped being a nun. Will and Lyra picnic in the wood and kiss. The flow of dust escaping is slowed and envelops Will and Lyra. Balthamos prevents Father Gomez from killing Lyra and allows himself to disperse into the air. The witch Serafina Pekkala and angel Xaphania explain that openings between worlds allow dust to escape into oblivion, each creating a new spectre; no more must be created and all the existing windows must be closed, except the one leading from the world of the dead. Lyra and Will must return to their own worlds, as they are unable to survive in worlds other than their own. Lyra leads Will to the Botanic Gardens in his Oxford. They promise to go to a bench in their respective Oxfords every midsummer's day to think of each other. Will and Mary return to their worlds. Will deliberately breaks the subtle knife by trying to open a window while thinking about Lyra. Mary learns how to see her own dæmon, a black Alpine chough. Will's dæmon, named Kirjava by Serafina, has taken the permanent form of a large black cat. Lyra returns to Jordan College in her world. Having lost her ability to intuitively read the alethiometer, a truth-telling device, she decides to study alethiometry. She and her dæmon Pantalaimon, who has taken the permanent form of a pine marten, resolve to build the Republic of Heaven.<br/><br/>{Characters} - The characters are all about Paris, Asriel and Mrs. Coulter, the Gullevespians, Tialys and Salmakia, Lyra don't Will, Balthamos and Balruch, Angels and Metratron. Charcters are developed and complementary to each other. I'm astouned after realizing how much Will and Lyra have grown, Mrs. Coulter is a completely different person now,benevolent and comapssionate, at least towards her daughter. The characters are bound together by strong emotional thread that the auhtor has now put forward in front of the readers. I would truly like to mention the fact that some amazing characters relations are freely and surprisingly revealed in the books. Not just this, the book comomerates the previously deceased characters and also this who die in this one. I was delighted to see creatures from various world's, ghosts, townspeople, military generals, spies and companions as additional new characters throughout the book. The people's demons are stressed more than ever and have gained utmost importance, especially Pantaliamon, the Golden Monkey and Will's new demon. The demons react to situations and other characters very well and the true essence of the story is clearly depicted through them. There are quite a number of scenes an unforgettable memory about these demons will be embedded in your brain, especially Will's and Lyra's. Many notable characters in the book, or rather the series, meet their destiny here. Iorek Brynison is formidable as ever. The Spectres, the Authority and the angel Metratron are considerable antagnosts along with a few things and goons. Dr. Mary Malone is regarded as primary character as she fashions the Amber Spyglass and makes remarkable new discoveries about Dust and helps the universe balance itself. A delightful set of characters I'll never forget. I loved Mrs. Coulter in this book and her haughty love for her daughter along with her role of a sacrificing mother. Lyra's and Will's emotional attachment seems very interesting but it's sad at the end. Nonetheless, the book has 'A' rate characters that will amazed you with their powerful style and oratory dialogues. I forget to mention that the book also expands on the Consistorial Court and it's factions and about the Heads of the Magisterium and how they send the Assassin, Father Gomez and the political world in Jordan and Oxford.<br/><br/>{Scenes}- Battle, Escape, Inspirational Speeches, Love, Discoveries, Fights, Futuristic Aeronautical Warfare, Destiny <br/>are some scenes you'll be seeing throughout the book. The Battle scenes are truly wonderful. The story can be classfied into arcs based on scnes, like Will rescuing Lyra, Journey into the Underworld, The Battle of the Clouded Mountain, Saving the Dust and Conclusion. These scenes are highlighted with very well written ialiuges. The book is big so expect some slow plotlines. These scenes did not fail to amaze me. The complexity of the plot is something that grabs you and hooks you to read on chapters.  The ending was perfect, it nearly made me cry. The book teases spying, Battle and a lot more if your read carefully. As new world's can be explored much more has to be taken into consideration. The subtlties of the writing are clearly expressed. Morever, I loved the way how Lyra and Will help the ghosts escape into the new world's and relish themselves in their lovely spirits. Some scenes are too beautiful to put into words, the author has done a remarkable job. The scenes are thrilling, exciting, surprising, awe-inspiring, wonderful, scary and extensively philospohial. Many philosophical ideas are expressed throughout the book. It's so dumb of me not to highlight them, I hope I can find them on the internet. The scenes from the book indirectly make you curious about the how the universe works, the life force and emotions of all the living organisms. Expect the book to be very rational, spiritual and questioning. Some horrifying and blood curling acts are also present. The story builds up slowly and ends before you can expect it. You will devour this book if you are a fantasy/sci-fi/ literature fan.<br/><br/>{Locations}-  Primary locations include Jordan, Oxford, Will's World, Otherworld, Earth, The Middle Highway, the Botanical Garden, The Clouded Mountain, beaches, hilltops, Magisterium, Abyss, Underworld and labratories. Surely, those who haven't read the first two book should keep their hands of this book. You wouldn't understand a word!!! The locations are richly described, around 5000 words for each location, so around 50 pages entirely dedicated to the climate, physiography, associated characters and the overall features. It has a very powerful visual impact. This rich and vivid location description allowed me to actually imagine these places visually in front of my eyes, thus the characters became lively and came out of the book and acted in front of me, just like a play.  There's great amount of Work  done by Hon' Mr. Philip Pullman who has put his back into writing such deep and vastly astounding material of literature that has possessed the heart of many, his research Is send clearly in the books, the descriptions and the Rich vocabulary used. Many characters are soociated with some specific locations. These locations play a key role in determining the plot lines and give the readers a hint of what's about to happen next. These locations are just as important as the characters. As the new world's are opened up, we get to see a lot of new exciting, beuatiful and Damned locations that help the story grow and delight the readers. A wonderful choice @ Mr. Pullman. There's a lot of variety and diversity.<br/><br/>{Speciality}- This is possibly the first book which questions all the laws of nature and universe and the auhtor freely expresses his philospohical thoughts through the characters in the book.  The emotional attachment to is expressed richly and is somewhat sadenning.  The book establishes new world's, characters, locations and with such rich detailed narration, it feels very realistic, mind you, I felt as if I lived in these characters and walked on the summer beaches and went through all the sadness, adventure and fun. It keeps you entertaining, every single page, every single word. I could go on and on but reviews have character limit.  <br/><br/>{Notes} - You shouldn't read this book if you haven't read the first two. The book has high vocabulary, English Dictionary recommended while reading. (Or just buy a Kindle!) You will be sacrificing your sleep in order to read a few more chapters, I bet! Please highlight all the passages, prose, dialouges and scenes that you would like to read in the future, I regret I didn't do this! Read the peotic lines above each chapter carefully, they are close resembelence to the chapters and particular storyline. Read each words, each page with full attention to grab the most out of the book, get away from any hindering audio/video source. <br/><br/>{Remarks}- This will be one of the most cherished and memorable literary series in my life, truly the characters, scenes and the ideas expressed have changed the way I think. Hats off to Mr. Philip Pullman for writing such a great work of art. I feel blessed to read your incredible work. Recommned to all! Young and old, read on!<br/><br/>{Rating} - 5/5 (Undoubtedly!)",,,1,0

Their destinies fse together and united, they fight Mr. Coulter, her minions and ghastly Spectres from a completely differnet world. Now, they seek a weapon that can cut potals open through worlds, the Subtle Knife or the Aeshatter. The book shifts between three distinct worlds with a load of new characters.<br/><br/>{Storyline}-Twelve-year-old Will Parry is caring for his mentally ill mother. He accidentally kills an intruder and runs away to Oxford, where he discovers a portal to a parallel universe. In the deserted city of Cittàgazze, he encounters 12-year-old Lyra Silvertongue and her dæmon Pantalaimon, who arrived via a bridge in the sky created by her father, Lord Asriel.<br/>The witch Serafina Pekkala eavesdrops on Mrs. Coulter, Lyra's wicked mother, torturing a witch for the prophecy that concerns Lyra. Serafina and a troop of witches search for Lyra, while aeronaut Lee Scoresby searches for Stanislaus Grumman; Grumman may have knowledge of a powerful object which Scoresby intends to use to protect Lyra.<br/>Will returns to his world through the portal and finds information about his father, who went missing on an expedition. Lyra searches Will's Oxford for information about Dust, mysterious particles connected to consciousness. On the advice of her alethiometer, a truth-telling device, Lyra meets the physicist Dr. Mary Malone, who has a machine that communicates with dark matter. Police question Lyra and her knowledge of Will, and she accidentally gives him away.<br/>After accepting a lift from a gentleman introducing himself as Sir Charles Latrom, Lyra realises he has stolen her alethiometer. Sir Charles forces Will and Lyra into retrieving a mysterious knife from Cittàgazze for the alethiometer's return. They defeat a youth who has taken the knife from its holder, Giacomo Paradisi, but Will loses two fingers in the fight. Giacomo explains that this is the sign of the knife's next bearer, and explains its power: the ability to cut through any material, even the fabric between worlds. He also explains that their world is haunted by soul-eating Spectres, which prey on older children and adults but are invisible to children.<br/>Will uses the knife to cut a hole from Cittàgazze into Charles's home. They overhear a conversation with Mrs Coulter; Lyra realises that Charles is Lord Boreal, having gone to Will's world long ago, and Will hears news of his father, who discovered a doorway between the worlds. They escape to Cittàgazze with the alethiometer and are rescued from marauding children by Serafina Pekkala, who attempts unsuccessfully to heal Will's wound with a spell.<br/>Dr. Malone is visited by Sir Charles, who threatens to use his connections to cut their funding if they do not co-operate with his wishes. Dr. Malone returns at night to follow Lyra's suggestion to communicate with the dark matter using a machine of her invention. The dark matter instructs her to travel through the same window between worlds used by Will and Lyra, and that her role is to ""play the serpent"".<br/>Lee Scoresby finds Grumman living as a shaman known as Jopari, a corruption of his original name, John Parry, Will's father. Grumman has summoned Scoresby to take him to the bearer of the knife and assist in Lord Asriel's rebellion against the Authority. They set off in Scoresby's hot air balloon but are forced to land by Magisterium soldiers. Scoresby dies holding off the soldiers so that Grumman can complete his task.<br/>Mrs. Coulter tricks Charles into revealing the secret of the knife and kills him. She uses the spectres, which she has learned to control, to torture a witch into revealing the prophecy: Lyra is the second Eve. Mrs. Coulter plans to destroy Lyra rather than risk a second Fall.<br/>Serafina goes to aid Scoresby, having heard his last plea for help. Will encounters Grumman, who staunches the bleeding in his hand and instructs him in his task. Grumman is killed by a vengeful witch whose love he once spurned. Will returns to camp to find a pair of angels, Balthamos and Baruch, waiting to guide him to Lord Asriel. He goes to awaken Lyra, but discovers she is missing and her guardian witches have been killed by spectres. Will finds her alethiometer and refuses to go with the angels until he finds Lyra.<br/><br/>{Character}- Surprisingly, the book has a whole lot of new characters, mainly as two new worlds are added to the previously known world. Namely, an Earth like modern world much like ours and a completely different world corrupted by Spectres. Mind You, spectares, like ghasts or soul demons play a key role in the book an dmurder around 5-6 characters. We also have a new major character, equally important as Lyra if not more who is introduced right from the first chapter and Boy! I do love him much more than Lyra. He's a human, does not posses a demon and his personality is truly Earthly. he worries, he thieves, he escapes and he plans, in simple terms, he's wise, intelligent and practical and can cope with situations. His father's Introduction is nice too. It gives a kind of flow and points where the story is progressing by setting up a quest in front of the major character. Pantalimon is not given as much importance as compared to the first book, but he is surely in the light. Recurring characters inlcude Mr. Lee Scoresby who acts as a sidekick and the only person from the original world from which Lyra belongs to, on a quest to find Grumman. We see very little of Lord Asriel. The witch queen, Serfina Pekkala is raised to the next level and she too, enters a new world. The new world has many children, mostly playing small and boring parts. Another notable character is Dr. Malone who investigates the Dark Matter A.K.A Dust and helps Lyra in discovering the truth about things. Her contribution in the story cannot be neglected. SHe has got a rational and a somewhat od personality. Lord Boreal A.K.A Sir Charles plays as a vice-antagonist, followed by the return of Mrs. Coulter. The characters can be differentiated according to the parralel worlds joined through portals in which the story takes place. Minor characters include demons of people, cats, young children, Spectres, Old men, murders, police, doctors, Will's Mum, witch clans. The revelation that Grumman is Will's lost father is truly delightful and builds up the suspense for the climax. Guess what? The author has also introduced a fantastic group of angels to add beauty to the storyline.<br/><br/>{Scenes}- Scenes mostly include chasing, escaping, flying in the air, researching, killing, violence, retrieving and robbing. The dialouges are well written. There are too much Witch Scenes and discussions. Many scenes are clear and portray what the author wants to make us understand very easily. There is comparatively more violence here and a few notable deaths. Some events align and build up the suspense leading to a thrilling climax. In the beginning, the story moves slowly, giving up all the essential information regarding new characters and locations and once that it done, we come to know about layers in the story, getting complex as pages turn and finally building up a very engaging tale. Very well written scenes, actions and dialogues. The character interaction between young and old is quite funny. There is a constant conflict between our young protagonists and older antagonists. Lord Asriel's motives are seen more cearly. A great war is approaching. I like the angel thing.<br/><br/>{Locations}- Story takes place in three distinct worlds. Lyra's world, a cnnecting world, beautifully portrayed where most of the story takes place and another parallel world, joint by the connecting world, very much like ours, modern and Earthly. The locations are depicted very beautifully. Especially, the nothern Mountains, Forests and Zeppelins from Lyra's world through which Lee Scoresby travels and dies. The connecting world is a major location, the author has created a world which is too much credulous, believable and like a paradise, except it isn't. These locations atmosphere, beauty, nature, landscape are broadly described in depth. The new world is modern, has laboratories, bungalows and city roads. The Tower of Angels is where the Subtle Knife is located. Will can open up portals and can teleport to various worlds at one go. This is an original idea. Just loved the locations,  Way better than the first book, also enables the story to pace up faster and harder. <br/><br/>{Speciality}- New Worlds are added. Another Important device, the Subtle Knife is an original idea. The layers of plotlines combine and engage the reader. Descriptionsare beautiful and the story is a definitive page turner. An original idea and a myriad of characters bring about the completeness of an ideal high fantasy epic novel. <br/><br/>{Notes}- Some words are purposely spelled incorrectly. Do check out the witches poetry lines. Read Gurmmmans letters from his journal with complete attention. Take care you don't read while feeling sleepy, the plotlines may be confusing. Don't forget to sleep. Caution: Definitive Page Turner. Not for Kids under 13 as it contains high voacbulary and language and mild action scenes. It is quite essential to read t<br/>he first novel before laying hands on this .<br/><br/>{Remarks} Deifinately enjoyed it. Recommended to Sci-Fi, Epic Fantasy fans. You'll devour this. <br/><br/>{Rating} - 5/5 Simply Perfect.",,,2,0

One day, she witnesses the Master poison wine intended for Lord Asriel, Lyra's rebellious and adventuring uncle. She warns Asriel, then spies on his lecture about ""dust"", mysterious elementary particles attracted to adults more than children, and images of a parallel universe seen through the northern lights. The Oxford scholars agree to fund his research, which is considered heretical by the oppressive Church.<br/>Lyra's friend Roger goes missing, presumed kidnapped by child abductors the children call ""Gobblers"". Lyra is adopted by a charming socialite, Mrs Coulter. Before Lyra leaves Jordan, the Master secretly entrusts her with an alethiometer, a rare truth-telling device, which she quickly learns to use intuitively. After several weeks, Lyra discovers that Coulter is the head of the Gobblers, or General Oblation Board, a secret Church-funded project. Horrified, Lyra flees to the Gyptians, canal-faring nomads, many of whose children have also been abducted. They reveal to Lyra that Asriel and Coulter are her parents.<br/>The Gyptians form an expedition to the Arctic with Lyra, where they believe the Gobblers are holding their children. They stop in Trollesund, where Lyra meets Iorek Byrnison, the dispossessed royal heir of the panserbjørne armoured bears. Lyra uses her alethiometer to locate Iorek's missing armour; in return, he and his human aeronaut friend, Lee Scoresby, join her group. She also learns that Lord Asriel has been exiled, guarded by the panserbjørne on Svalbard. Trollesund's witch consul tells the Gyptians of a prophecy about Lyra which she must not know, and that the witch clans are choosing sides for a war.<br/>The party continues towards Bolvangar, the Gobbler research station. Guided by the alethiometer, Lyra detours at a village and discovers an abandoned child who has been cut from his dæmon and who soon dies. She realises the Gobblers are experimenting on children by severing the bond between human and dæmon, a soul-splitting process called intercision. Lyra and her companions are attacked by bounty hunters, and Lyra is captured and taken to Bolvangar, where she is reunited with Roger.<br/>Coulter arrives and halts the intercision process as Lyra and Pantalaimon are about to be separated. She tells Lyra that the intercision prevents the onset of troubling adult emotions. Lyra engages Bolvangar's emergency alarm, sets the station on fire, and leads the children outside, where they are rescued by Scoresby, Iorek, the Gyptians, and Serafina Pekkala's flying witch clan. Lyra, Roger, and Iorek flee in Scoresby's hot air balloon as a battle erupts. Lyra directs the witches to tow the balloon towards Asriel in Svalbard, but she falls out and is taken by the panserbjørne to the castle of their usurping king, Iofur Raknison. She tricks Iofur into fighting Iorek, who arrives with the others to rescue Lyra. Iorek kills Iofur and takes his place as the rightful king.<br/>Lyra, Iorek, and Roger travel to Svalbard, where Asriel has continued his Dust research in exile. He tells Lyra all he knows of Dust: that it has spawned parallel universes, it is somehow connected to death and misery, and that the Church believes it is the physical basis of sin. He plans to visit the other universes and destroy the source of Dust. Suddenly, he severs Roger from his dæmon, killing Roger, releasing an enormous amount of energy, and tearing a hole in the northern lights to a parallel universe, through which he walks. Lyra, devastated, decides that Dust may be a force of good rather than evil. Vowing to stop Asriel, she and Pantalaimon pass through the opening in the sky.<br/><br/>{Characters} - The book is full of wonderful characters right from tiny tots to old and experienced gentlemen. Additionally to this, the pages are flooded with Major characters demons who play a major role influencing the storyline. These characters have drastically different traits that are worth noting. Demons are also treated as major characters, especially Pantalimon. The author has portrayed each and every character honestly after a lot of studying. Their behaviour habits, speaking style, attire is different and unique. Lyra's character is undoubtedly my favorite. She is an innocent and barbaric girl from Oxford who likes to get into trouble and unaware of her destiny she tries to save her friends and highlights a child's curious mind exploring and experimenting with new things. Rarely do we see a young feminine protagonist in children's fantasy. She is helpful, robust, wild, revolting, clever and compassionate. Next up we have her demon, the metamorphic Pantalimon who can transform into any desired animal and advices Lyra and accompanies get everywhere. His participation in the story is undeniable. We also have Lord Asriel, Lyra's father who is a mysterious person. He is an ambitious man with a rational and a scientific perspective and wants to achieve the seemingly impossible. He makes use of the available resources and people around him to achieve his despotic goals. His human emotions have been rarely displayed and he seems to be a person without emotional attachment towards anything. His demon is magnificent snow leopard. Lord Asriel is well versed and an ingenious scientist and equally eloquent. The book features a despotic, maleficent, ruthless antagonist, Mrs. Coulter, none other than Lyra's mother and L.A's Wife. She and her gross demon monkey establish the obligation board responsible for operation of demons and their owners. She is truly ghastly. On the outside get charming style is notable and that's why everybody is Dominated by her. She is an exploiter, taking advantage of everybody else. Her external appearance is overrated.  The bear Iofur Raknison indeed changes the complete story as the bear fight occurs. The difference between humans and nondemonic animals is struck by him. He is energentic, powerful and a courageous animal character who willingly helps Lyra through her quest and defeats the usurper to grab his throne. Iofurs behaviour is insensitive and barbaric. Later on, he does develop a sensational feeling towards Lyra and Humans. Other characters include Robert, Billy, The Master, Lyra friends and acqintances who do influence the story more or less. The witches are a peculiar lot who are protrayed traditionally in the Frozen North. The characters interact very well with each other. Lord Asriels and John Faas dialogues will continue to inspire me for their great philosophical ideas. <br/><br/>{Scenes}- Scenes mainly include dialouges and comparitively less action. We see some kind of politics in Oxford, Lyra's exploring and adventuring in the first part. Later on, scenes include journeys through icy mountains, escapement, etc. Throughout these scenes the author describes various traits and descriptions of locations, characters etc. Violence is notable at the end, at the bear fight and done incersion scenes. Butt not blood and Gore. No explicit scenes are seen in the book. Perfect for children above 12 due to high vocabulary used. The outline of the story is planned very well.<br/><br/>{Locations} - Rich and beautifully drives locations include Oxford, Bolvangar and Svlbard. A large part of the book is full of descriptions of places, climate and lifestyle of the people living there. Pullman had created a replica of Earth, a better Earth in fact and immersed the reader into an utterly realistic universe the reader would never come out of! Snowy mountains, Coastal peninsulas, modern and futuristic cities, Golden Palaces and an interested bridge are some of the highlights where major plotlines can be seen. These locations are scientifically supported. The beauty of the northern lights/ Aurora is repeatedly depicted beautifully, so much that it isn't difficult at all the imagine the picturesque night starry sky. <br/><br/>{Speciality} - Undoubtedly the first and the foremost speciality of the book that comes tothe readers mind is the demon human relationship. It's like the western version of Pokemon where people and their demons (spirit animals) cannot part and are a part and parcel of each other, existence in absence of each other impossible. It's wonderful to see how humans depend on their demons and can't be torn away. The next speciality is the rational and the scientific terms expressed in the book with some new and peculiar words invented by the author added to the story. It's a casket of wonders. The story flows smoothly with an even pace and the conclusion is truly unpredictable and most surprising. Also, a realistic world supported by rationalism and scienctific facts has been set up, unlike any other literary Parallel universe. Here, demons and humans interact. The Golden Compass is the central idea of the story and its fantastic to see the Golden Compass referred to as the Altheometer answer all kinds of questions. It is indeed an original idea. In fact, the entire story is an ideal and an original children's fantasy. It takes you on an unforgettable journey. I liked the decoding of the Altheometer and Lyra's skill. Also Dust, Aurora, the Hidden city are some original ideas that are delightful when understood clearly. <br/>What I Didn't Like -  The chapters are very much big. It's difficult to complete a big chapter when you're sleepy but still want to turn another page. <br/><br/>{Notes}- Very high vocabulary is used at some places. Referring dictionary is suggested. Recommended to 14+ children. I learnt about 150 new words. Chapters are quite big story is divided into 3 sections according to story locations. Narration is from single point of view. Additional appendix and teaser of the second book is included to further incline the readers into the rich world of His Dark Materials. A pleasure reading. Devoured it. Emotions like friendship,over, hatred, compassion, imagination, curiousity, bravery, etc are seen throughout the book. Action scenes are quite wonderful. Hoping to see major characters in the following book. Chapter illustrations are beautiful and font is legible for reading.<br/><br/>{Remarks}- Simply Perfect. <br/><br/>{Rating}- 5/5",,,1,0
